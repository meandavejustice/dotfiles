dotfiles
========

## System
* Lenovo Thinkpad x1 with i7 and no silly touchscreen
* Arch Linux
* Emacs 24
* XMonad

Starting point is `.xprofile`.
Lots of useful bash functions in ~/bin
Some node modules I like to keep installed globally are listed in `global-modules.txt`

## Everyday Apps
* Xmonad --tiling window manager
* Xmobar --statusbar
* Emacs24 --os
* mplayer --music, generally controlled by EMMS
* arch's wifi-menu with netctl --networking
* xScreensaver --lockscreen/screensaver
* feh --set background
* Firefox Nightly --mainsqueeze
* Chromium --node-debugging
* git --not much customization here
* gimp --photo manipulation
* scrot --screenshots
* weechat --irc. this is actually running in a tmux session on a digital ocean instance, I just ssh into it.

## Lesser Used Apps
* Firefox with pentadactyl --still getting used to pentadactyl
* googlechrome --testing
* surf --focused browsing
* lynx --I have a function to compile .md files to html which pipes to lynx for quick viewing.
* Nicotine.py --soulseek client for p2p
* Transmission --torrents
* LightDM --Login Manager (There is a webkit fork of this I've been meaning to spend some time with)
* supercollider --music creation

## Overall

Overall this system isn't all that crazy, I've just pieced together some pretty small
software I really like. The main customization is mostly around my `/bin` and `.xprofile`.
Most things are done in emacs anyways.
