2013-09-26 13:59:16	vosechu	new weekend project for sure
2013-09-26 14:04:51	badascii	yeah it is pretty glorious
2013-09-26 14:05:07	badascii	and we can customize our personal puppet files to add whatever utilities we personally want
2013-09-26 14:07:51	badascii	they told us that if we are ever installing anything via homebrew that we are doing it wrong
2013-09-26 14:08:10	badascii	we are instead supposed to add it to our boxen 
2013-09-26 14:09:58	theoretick	unfortunately, one issue with boxen is you can't install it on top of a pre-existing system, you pretty much have to wipe everything and use it from teh beginning
2013-09-26 14:12:37	badascii	we have separate partitions to solve that problem
2013-09-26 14:12:44	badascii	and wait
2013-09-26 14:12:51	badascii	johann says he set his up on his same laptop from pcs
2013-09-26 14:13:13	keighty	this is a very cool tool!
2013-09-26 14:20:43	johannhann	I am indeed running boxen on my pcs laptop
2013-09-26 14:20:46	johannhann	I had to uninstall homebrew
2013-09-26 14:20:56	johannhann	but that was really the only prerequisite to get it working
2013-09-26 14:21:14	johannhann	and change some permissions for user accounts
2013-09-26 14:21:25	johannhann	but yeah, I didn't need a fresh OSX install

2013-09-26 14:52:53	badascii	walk it out
2013-09-26 14:53:01	badascii	I SAID WALK IT OUT
2013-09-26 14:53:15	badascii	(the tradition carries on)
2013-09-26 14:53:19	johannhann	3 o clock walk, wherever you are
2013-09-26 14:53:23	johannhann	you're still in my heart
2013-09-26 14:53:58	zeisler	I've transitioned to an after lunch walk
2013-09-26 14:54:46	johannhann	not a bad time for it
2013-09-26 14:55:47	johannhann	sometimes I 3 o clock walk at midnight
2013-09-26 14:56:06	zeisler	On another note I finally have a valid copy of sublime text, no more bugging reminder to buy it. YES!
2013-09-26 14:56:24	johannhann	pcs_hubot: image me money
2013-09-26 14:56:24	pcs_hubot	http://www.opensecrets.org/news/bigstock_Falling_Money_669153.jpg
2013-09-26 14:56:40	johannhann	thats how you pay for sublime
2013-09-26 14:56:42	johannhann	:)
2013-09-26 14:57:01	johannhann	i'll get a valid copy eventually if these guys don't convert me to vim
2013-09-26 14:57:31	zeisler	Well that would be cool, but I just asked my boss to buy me a copy
2013-09-26 14:57:47	johannhann	thats the trick right there
2013-09-26 14:58:05	johannhann	alright, walk time
2013-09-26 14:58:42	zeisler	My boss really likes ruby mine, which is ok for some stuff but it gets in my way most of the time

2013-09-27 16:23:26	badascii	might be biased cause its javascript but
2013-09-27 16:24:18	badascii	and using the native browser language to test…browser functionality just feels right
2013-09-27 16:24:50	badascii	plus you can call .evaluate and plug in any javascript you want and fully access the dom

2013-10-02 15:36:56	johannhann	when we started on irc during the last session the prior students had pretty much cleared out, so i'm hoping we can build on the fact that most of my session is still online

2013-11-08 16:02:09	Wraithan	it has an emphemeral (by default, you can change that) filesystem so you can write to it and it just goes away when you close it down
2013-11-08 16:02:42	Wraithan	docker is typically used to run jobs that you don't want to have access to other things on your system, nor be affected by
2013-11-08 16:03:45	Wraithan	I use the underlying tech, lxc, to break my server apart in to many servers but all having the full power of the server (don't have to break it down to like 1gb of ram for htis one, 3 for another, 2 cpus for one, 1 for another etc) 
2013-11-08 16:04:48	Wraithan	It also gets a virtual network device that ties to the host system one, so you can use tools like iptables to route your incoming traffic from the outside to specific containers on the inside of your server
2013-11-08 16:06:16	Wraithan	i can explain any part of that in greater detail if needed, some of that might not be familiar to newer folks in the field or folks who haven't been a sysadmin
2013-11-08 16:06:40	 *	Wraithan gets on a bus to go hack with friends for node knockout

2013-11-09 10:42:22	nilesvm	It seems like it's a really intensive process. 
2013-11-09 10:42:28	Wraithan	It takes a high level of compatability, and even then it is a learned skill and may lower productivity when you first start with a new person
2013-11-09 10:42:34	nilesvm	I don't know how ppl do it for 8 hours a day.
2013-11-09 10:44:02	Wraithan	A friend of mine at a couple companies ago, he and I pair programmed multiple times a week. We had a hard time getting past 5-6 hours
