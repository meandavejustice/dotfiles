2013-12-23 09:53:33	brycebaril	terinjokes yeah I started late and and if I wasn't in a pool I'd have nothing. It's almost doubled difficulty in the last week
2013-12-23 09:53:40	terinjokes	:(

2013-12-23 09:55:58	brycebaril	A week of mining with 128 cores has netted me 40k, that's a bump in difficulty

2013-12-23 09:57:27	brycebaril	still, that's a pretty decent haul
2013-12-23 09:57:36	terinjokes	that's like 12 hours i think
2013-12-23 09:57:48	terinjokes	before my room got too warm that I turned off my computer and opened the window
2013-12-23 09:57:56	brycebaril	any idea what your hash rate was?
2013-12-23 09:58:22	terinjokes	i have 7141 DOGE sitting in my account on the pool
