2013-05-17 22:15:32	AAA_awright	For instance, I have a single repository that stores all my JSON Schemas
2013-05-17 22:15:45	AAA_awright	So all of my HTTP servers and clients know exactly what the schema looks like
2013-05-17 22:15:53	AAA_awright	And anyone else can downlad them at the URL and see too
2013-05-17 22:16:00	AAA_awright	It's extremely powerful
2013-05-17 22:17:08	nog	yea, i get it.. a portable schema... one definition across all levels... i guess i am just weary of it being a code defined schema
2013-05-17 22:18:20	Stumbler	__dirname seems to be lowercasing the 'D' on my 'Desktop' folder, is that normal behavior?   (I'll move my project folder closer to root to avoid my problem, but it seems odd)

2013-05-17 22:29:38	DarkArgon	so just the D is Desktop?

2013-05-17 22:31:10	nog	im just stating that if the code enforces the schema of an object to be persisted... and the backend db doesnt care about schema... you will eventually have creep on the backend data schema... 
2013-05-17 22:31:15	Stumbler	yup.  console.log(__dirname)   produces "/Users/jonathan/desktop/node/batchScanner"

2013-05-17 22:31:32	Stumbler	where it should be /Users/jonathan/Desktop/node/batchScanner
2013-05-17 22:31:36	nog	so you have to convert all your backend data at the time of a schema change in the code..
2013-05-17 22:31:52	DarkArgon	lol...and you're sure you can't cd /Users/jonathan/desktop ?
2013-05-17 22:31:54	Stumbler	I'm guessing its a special folder thing..  moving it back in the chain

2013-05-18 03:39:46	deoxxa	zapu: submodules are probably a bad idea - you can set up your own NPM registry fairly easily though, which is what i have set up at work
2013-05-18 03:39:50	sinclair|nz	deoxxa: i get an empty buffer returned intermittently from a socket
2013-05-18 03:40:01	zapu	using npm was what I was going to do first
2013-05-18 03:40:03	deoxxa	zapu: or you can use git urls in package.json
2013-05-18 03:40:10	zapu	even without my own registry
2013-05-18 03:40:13	zapu	yeah, this exactly

2013-05-18 03:46:44	deoxxa	with streams2, when you .read() you can sometimes get null

2013-05-18 03:46:44	sinclair|nz	oh?
2013-05-18 03:46:58	deoxxa	that might have leaked into the legacy interface
2013-05-18 03:47:18	deoxxa	if it is, as you say, actually `null', and not just an empty buffer

2013-05-18 03:48:25	deoxxa	well when you .read() from a streams2 stream.Readable, it'll return null if there's nothing to return
2013-05-18 03:48:42	deoxxa	then you listen for the "readable" event and try again when it fires

2013-05-18 03:49:20	deoxxa	listening to the "data" event is a bit hacky - would it not be practical to implement a writable stream to consume the data instead (so you can do .pipe())?
2013-05-18 03:49:53	deoxxa	but as for why it's actually emitting a data event with null as the argument, i'm not sure

2013-05-18 03:55:51	deoxxa	sinclair|nz: there's actually a way easier way to do most (nearly all) userland stream things - stream.Transform - take a look at https://github.com/naomik/burro/blob/master/lib/framer.js for a pretty simple example of how that works
2013-05-18 03:55:52	sinclair|nz	nathan7: one thing im not sure is reading from a socket
2013-05-18 03:56:19	nathan7	sinclair|nz: an actual socket
2013-05-18 03:56:24	nathan7	sinclair|nz: or a net.Socket?
2013-05-18 03:56:27	sinclair|nz	nathan7: yes
2013-05-18 03:56:39	nathan7	sinclair|nz: as in, is it an actual node stream
2013-05-18 03:56:45	nathan7	sinclair|nz: or is it something funky from C++land
2013-05-18 03:56:56	sinclair|nz	nathan7: no no, all node
2013-05-18 03:57:05	sinclair|nz	nathan7: let me check something quick
2013-05-18 03:57:11	nathan7	sinclair|nz: well, then you probably want a transformstream or something
2013-05-18 03:57:19	deoxxa	stream.Transform <3
2013-05-18 03:57:20	nathan7	sinclair|nz: streams2 is pull streams
2013-05-18 03:57:22	nathan7	sinclair|nz: not push streams
2013-05-18 03:57:39	deoxxa	sinclair|nz: another example of a Transform stream - https://gist.github.com/deoxxa/5295806
2013-05-18 03:57:45	nathan7	sinclair|nz: .read() on a TransformStream will .read() on what is piped to it, etc
2013-05-18 03:57:46	sinclair|nz	deoxxa: export interface NodeSocket extends stream.ReadWriteStream 
2013-05-18 03:57:50	nathan7	sinclair|nz: so the read drives things
2013-05-18 03:58:03	nathan7	sinclair|nz: the data sink is driving everything

2013-05-18 03:59:52	deoxxa	sinclair|nz: it's going to be a lot easier to talk about internal node.javascript interfaces in terms of javascript. since they are javascript. talking about them in terms of your typescript wrappers will involve a lot of guessing on both sides.

2013-05-18 04:08:40	sinclair|nz	i need a picture :(
2013-05-18 04:08:48	nathan7	sinclair|nz: You probably don't want to
2013-05-18 04:08:57	nathan7	sinclair|nz: what is your use case?
2013-05-18 04:09:00	deoxxa	^ this
2013-05-18 04:09:21	sinclair|nz	nathan7: FTP client, the socket connects to a PASV endpoint and reads data from it
2013-05-18 04:09:24	deoxxa	sinclair|nz: i do a ton of stuff with streams at work, and i nearly never have to think about .read() - transform streams are where it's at
2013-05-18 04:09:40	sinclair|nz	i wish to return to the caller the same interface as one would get for a fs.createReadStream() 
2013-05-18 04:10:00	sinclair|nz	except, it would be socket.createReadStream()
2013-05-18 04:10:23	deoxxa	sinclair|nz: mainly because what you usually want to do isn't actually "read from this stream", it's "get some data from this stream into this other one, doing some stuff along the way", which is exactly what transform streams were designed for
2013-05-18 04:10:25	sinclair|nz	this way, i could pipe the output from the socket into a file for example

2013-05-18 04:34:01	nathan7	It works in fucking IE6

2013-05-18 04:36:11	geNAZt	and then ?

2013-05-18 04:36:24	nathan7	that's not part of CS
2013-05-18 04:36:27	dhzr	whoa...
2013-05-18 04:36:34	geNAZt	well thats part of nodejs

2013-05-18 04:54:40	geNAZt	sinclair|nz, yes JS compiler can do more advanced things. But on the other hand they require workaround for a handful of things which are off from javascript. And thats the point why i dont like it. Far off from the syntax which is the second thing i dont like about those compiler to js things.

2013-06-26 11:35:01	Petrogad	I'm trying to understand the best way to find where slowness occurs in my Express app. I'm running jmeter at it and see things start to stack up from 31ms to 350ms.. but don't really know how to isolate the particular part of the route.  Are there any suggestions of what you've done that might help diagnose the issue?

2013-06-26 14:57:51	Hochmeister	the problem is, in my real app (not the simplified example) I'm grouping by a url. Then in my JavaScript I'm building DOM elements using that _id value that comes back from the aggregation pipeline. However, I cannot decorate links and such with the url value (it also gets injected into the window.location.hash). I want to use some obfuscation here...
