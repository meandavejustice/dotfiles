2013-10-20 20:48:54	aidalgol	twb: Notes with math and tables.
2013-10-20 20:49:02	twb	I think aidalgol means his collaborator wants to use a WYSIWYG word processor, specifically, winword.
2013-10-20 20:49:07	aidalgol	The math part leaves out just about every word processor.
2013-10-20 20:49:20	aidalgol	twb: Close: Mac Word, actually.
2013-10-20 20:49:32	rryoumaa	although i must say, org spreadsheets are NOT something you can just start using and have them work.  you really have to struggle with those.
2013-10-20 20:49:42	SamB	aidalgol: you mean they didn't port winword to mac yet
2013-10-20 20:49:46	twb	I'm only calling it winword because that's the name of the binary
2013-10-20 20:49:56	twb	As opposed to DOS word I guess
2013-10-20 20:50:18	rryoumaa	aidalgol: how about tsv?

2013-10-20 20:50:52	aidalgol	It has to *look* nice at some point, rryoumaa.
2013-10-20 20:51:01	twb	aidalgol: you do that in post-production
2013-10-20 20:51:05	aidalgol	The tables are meant to be human readable, not just machine readable.
2013-10-20 20:51:14	rryoumaa	tsv does look nice for some input, but my point was you'd convert when necessary

2013-10-20 22:15:12	tali713	SamB: yeah, so the wikipedia article confirms my memory, early power rangers did use footage form a bunch of different series.

2013-10-20 22:15:56	tali713	SamB: so there was no japanese power rangers, but the toys could be easily recycled.

I have emacs 24.2.1 (standard in new Ubuntu distro) and I am trying out skeleton-complete-mode (https://github.com/baohaojun/skeleton-complete) which uses 'cl-notany' function. I figured out that this function is part of Common Lisp 'extensions' in Emacs; however, it is missing in my 24.2.1 release...

2013-10-21 15:58:57	nicferrier	technomancy: seen a few. not this one. thanks.
2013-10-21 15:58:58	mathrick	I don't have the budget to get into laptop manufacture
2013-10-21 15:59:03	chee	technomancy: is 2007 old enough
2013-10-21 15:59:13	mathrick	and there are no vendors who'd deserve my money on the market anymore
2013-10-21 15:59:28	technomancy	mathrick: they have people hooking apple][cs keyboards up to raspberry pis for pete's sake
2013-10-21 16:00:04	mathrick	technomancy: half the reason I bought thinkpads was because it was a purchase that just damn worked. With all the things I wanted in it, more or less
2013-10-21 16:00:20	mathrick	if it no longer has those things and I have to fuck with it to get it to work properly, what's the point?
2013-10-21 16:00:37	technomancy	well, the bar gets progressively lower over time
2013-10-21 16:00:56	mathrick	also what are the chances x240 is going to have a compatible form factor to make it possible to hook up an x220 keyboard?
2013-10-21 16:01:14	nicferrier	battery powered pi with a plugin keyboard is half way there.
2013-10-21 16:01:19	nicferrier	just need a screen.
2013-10-21 16:01:22	mathrick	thinkpad + duct tape is not exactly something I consider appropriately sturdy to stand up to my daily usage
2013-10-21 16:01:28	technomancy	mathrick: depends on your level of determination =)
2013-10-21 16:01:39	technomancy	how far are you willing to take this?
2013-10-21 16:01:48	nicferrier	in fact that makes the problem a lot easier. let's just make clam shell keyboard/screens that plug into pi.
2013-10-21 16:01:58	mathrick	given everything lenovo has done to persuade me not to continue to buy their products?
2013-10-21 16:02:01	mathrick	not far
2013-10-21 16:02:05	nicferrier	usb for displays?
2013-10-21 16:02:07	technomancy	you're no fun
2013-10-21 16:02:20	technomancy	nicferrier: HUD plz
2013-10-21 16:02:45	mathrick	technomancy: I have other, more interesting problems I'd rather be solving. Lenovo can bite my robot ass, I just want that shit to work and get out of my way

2013-10-21 16:20:04	jlf	pjb: rms has wrongly split the "GNU/Linux" hair on occasions where the victim was talking about a kernel-specific issue, so he is not as dedicated to correctness as he fancies himself.
2013-10-21 16:20:59	jlf	even so i do agree with his underlying argument
2013-10-21 16:22:09	aidalgol	jlf: I had not heard that before.  (I also agree with using GNU/Linux, and his argument, even though I often abbreviate it to Linux.)

2013-10-22 00:47:08	taylanub	What can a program do when it simply doesn't get memory in a place where it asks for it ?  If you don't want to do error-checking around every single malloc call (implausible), I suppose you'd need some global memory-exception handler which tries to free memory and re-execute the failed malloc, but if it can't straightforwardly free some memory you'll be in a dire situation ...
2013-10-22 00:47:25	ijp	taylanub: why should checking every malloc call be implausible?
2013-10-22 00:47:45	taylanub	It seems pretty insane ...
2013-10-22 00:47:46	ijp	do you ignore errors when you open a file? when a network call fails?

2013-10-22 00:49:20	zendeavor	taylanub: a wrapper for malloc could be written to do the error checking instead of manually doing it every time
2013-10-22 00:49:40	taylanub	zendeavor: Yes but not in every case is your recovery route the same.
2013-10-22 00:49:42	ijp	which people do, but then they just crash the program
2013-10-22 00:49:57	zendeavor	but then the problem would be, i presume, telling the kernel to free up some memory
2013-10-22 00:50:10	ijp	you want to manage your own resources, fine, but you should at least be an adult about it
2013-10-22 00:50:19	taylanub	The simplest thing to do is just run the GC when a malloc fails and retry; but if that fails, every place in which the malloc-fail can happen will probably need special handling ?
2013-10-22 00:50:30	zendeavor	and then what to do when there isn't enough free memory after gc
2013-10-22 00:50:49	ijp	simple, you give memory errors =before= you actually run out of enough memory to recover from it
2013-10-22 00:51:08	taylanub	Right, Emacs gives "memory 85% exhausted" and such errors.

2013-10-22 03:48:41	zendeavor	pacman never moves packages anywhere. they are downloaded directly to the cache location

2013-10-22 03:58:51	jenenliu	zendeavor: i know, but as i just start, i need some configurations first and then learn it myself
2013-10-22 03:58:56	zendeavor	i'm not sure i grok what fuzzy matching is supposed to do
2013-10-22 03:59:08	zendeavor	jenenliu: no, that's perfectly backwards

2013-10-22 03:59:57	zendeavor	webspid0r: if you put a space between two search terms it will match against both of them in any order
2013-10-22 04:00:06	jenenliu	zendeavor: really ? so it is better to learn elisp first ?
2013-10-22 04:00:25	webspid0r	jenenliu: no, it's better to fix the annoying things first, then gradually explore packages and customize them
2013-10-22 04:00:33	zendeavor	it is better to build up your configuration over time as you realize pain points
2013-10-22 04:00:34	webspid0r	jenenliu: then taking bits of other people's configs
2013-10-22 04:00:54	webspid0r	zendeavor: that kind of kills fuzzy matching
2013-10-22 04:01:44	zendeavor	don't like how a certain key sequence works? then learn how to bind it to something else. don't like what a function does? then learn how to write some elisp to do it your way (or perhaps advise the existing one if you're feeling bold).
2013-10-22 04:01:54	zendeavor	webspid0r: again, not sure what "fuzzy matching" really means

2013-10-22 11:10:09	jlf	,xapping is a data structure representing a unordered set of ordered pairs, first proposed by Danny Hillis and Guy Steele for the Connection Machine. In a xapping, each ordered pair has an index and a value. Indexes and values may be any Lisp object, including xappings. The pairs in a given xapping must have distinct indexes.

2013-10-22 13:12:42	quotemstr	I asked on #archlinux about stability and they started bickering about whether to 1) never update once it's working, or 2) update every day.

2013-10-22 14:41:35	jaimef	nicferrier: on web-http-get is there a way to return a value in a function? all I seem to get is a process and not the last value in the handler. https://gist.github.com/7108681
2013-10-22 14:41:38	technomancy	I don't expect it'd be much work to adapt marmalade.el, but someone's gotta actually get around to it
2013-10-22 14:42:05	nicferrier	technomancy: the web upload is done so I just need to send a multipart request file upload. it's so easy.
2013-10-22 14:42:16	jaimef	nicferrier: so lighthouse-list-tickets using *TICKETS* instead of returning a value and was trying to find an example where returning the value would avoid the need for a global.
2013-10-22 14:43:07	nicferrier	technomancy: you could write that if you like, or write an alternative upload backend that just takes a string and then write the webclient for that
2013-10-22 14:43:32	technomancy	nicferrier: programmatic upload is a bit different in that it's http basic auth too, right?

2013-10-22 21:02:59	twb	FWIW I wasn't thinking sexist thoughts when I made the original joke.  I was just implying that "eye candy" is only for kinky types and it gets in your face and makes it hard to see what you're doing

2013-10-23 08:56:55	brmj_work	I'm getting "Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size" for no obvious reason. I have tried increasing max-specpdl. It appeares to be happening when I try to use find-file-noselect to find a file that I know exists, and that I in fact can have open in a different buffer. I've gotten this error under these circumstances before, but it has gone away for some obscure reason. Any ideas?

2013-10-23 12:48:49	taylanub	That's just impossible; instead you have to arrange in some way for the macro to output some code, with the variable `spec' in the right places, which will do what you want.
2013-10-23 12:49:28	taylanub	That code that the macro outputs will then use the `spec' variable, but to the eyes of your macro it's entirely "opaque", the macro only uses the name of the variable and can't use it as a value.

2013-12-09 11:25:35	wgreenhouse	Lorcatar: customize-themes shows you a list of all your themes in a buffer, load-theme uses the minibuffer.  also customize-themes handles automatically disabling previous themes, load-theme is happy to enable one theme on top of another

2013-12-09 11:49:13	wgreenhouse	steckerhalter: yeah, emacsclient itself handles only text-mode connections.  for remote X emacsclient frames to work, you need something like ssh -X host emacsclient -c
2013-12-09 11:49:14	jbalnit	wgreenhouse: ok, lets say I have 1 session and I do (server-start), that "session" already has a frame. when i do emacsclient, it just opens a new buffer in that frame to edit that file. how can i get a separate frame for that client?
2013-12-09 11:49:27	wgreenhouse	jbalnit: emacsclient -c

2013-12-09 11:52:06	steckerhalter	jbalnit: you can do "emacsclient -a'' -c" - this starts the daemon if it was not running and opens a frame

2013-12-09 20:25:12	moto9	yeah, but not my point
2013-12-09 20:25:24	hoactzin	moto9: teiresias has a point i guess. but in organic language, there't ambiguity which requires context to resolve
2013-12-09 20:25:31	wgreenhouse	moto9: a giant regexp sounds like a frustrating place to stash a corpus
2013-12-09 20:26:08	wgreenhouse	of the basic emacs data types, a hash table is probably what you'd use for a large dictionary categorizing words by part of speech
2013-12-09 20:26:27	moto9	yeah, just trying out some searches
2013-12-09 20:26:28	hoactzin	human language is not regular. if you're trying to build a syntax tree with a regexp parser you'll quickly realize it's impossible

2013-12-10 04:24:53	forcer	Silex: Emacs Lisp allows a programmer to say "this variable here, this one is special" (using `make-variable-buffer-local'). After this, Emacs Lisp *can* know a separate value for a given buffer. But if a buffer has no special value for that variable, it uses the global value.

2013-12-10 10:26:37	HedgeMage	FWIW, one can commercialize copyleft stuff, too.
2013-12-10 10:26:38	quotemstr	JordiGH: You can argue that open-core software devaluates FOSS by making non-free software superior to FOSS.
2013-12-10 10:26:39	ruediger	JordiGH: I think BSD folks are very crazy in that regard.  They are happy when a big corporation rips them off.  But oh noez, no GPL software in the base system!!11!
2013-12-10 10:26:48	JordiGH	HedgeMage: Right, so you couldn't have a problem with assigning copyright so that exceptions can be sold?
2013-12-10 10:27:10	quotemstr	JordiGH: But as I see it, as long as the GPLed code is the same as the code with an exception, selling the exception does not harm to the free software movement, and can help make FOSS development sustainable.
2013-12-10 10:27:35	JordiGH	ruediger: This is a slightly different issue. It's about people who are unhappy about assigning copyright to a GPL'ed project so that exceptions can be sold.
2013-12-10 10:27:40	HedgeMage	JordiGH: I'm on the fence about copyright assignment for the following reasons (and I do make exceptions for cases that aren't subject to these concerns):
2013-12-10 10:27:52	quotemstr	ruediger: Have you considered that they dislike GPLed code in the base system precisely *because* it makes it harder to appropriate BSD code for commercial use?
2013-12-10 10:28:15	quotemstr	ruediger: After all, BSD developers want to make a living. If a company commercially uses BSD code, it's likely to hire existing BSD hackers to help.
2013-12-10 10:28:24	ruediger	quotemstr: GPLed code can be used commercially
2013-12-10 10:29:14	steckerhalter	where I work GPL seems to be considered the worst thing ever
2013-12-10 10:29:17	quotemstr	ruediger: Sure, but copyleft does exclude a big part of the set of commercial activities allowed. 
2013-12-10 10:29:19	tromey	for me it isn't about the money but about the symmetry
2013-12-10 10:29:20	ijp	nicferrier: you could have used (coerce "foobar" 'list)
2013-12-10 10:29:48	HedgeMage	1) Often, the org asking for copyright assignment is one likely to take actions I consider morally questionable.

2013-12-10 10:31:08	HedgeMage	2) There's the possibility that a single rightsholder can disappear, leaving no one able to go after violators, where multiple rightsholders can get together and handle this even if the author(s) of 5% of the codebase are missing.
2013-12-10 10:32:17	HedgeMage	3) Many such contracts are badly written, and asking for more than copyrightt assignment, or open me up to suit if I start disliking the current project and want to write a competitor from scratch.
2013-12-10 10:32:21	quotemstr	HedgeMage: Agreed, but I don't think it's a major problem. GPL violation is rampant anyway.

2013-12-10 10:33:46	quotemstr	HedgeMage: Agreed, but there are enough organizations doing GPL enforcement to create a social norm of following the GPL even in cases where the actual rightsholders have neglected their right to sue.

Most of those don't matter at all, other factors (unrelated to language choice) are a lot more important. But if you talk about languages, you can not look at one and say "issues!", you have to compare it to some other language.

2013-12-11 11:46:05	forcer	There's no self-reference in pure lambda calculus, so you need a way for a function to reference itself to do recursion. That's what Y does. Outside of "pure lambda calculus", you'd do it less awkwardly. Or at least hide it under some sensible syntax.

2013-12-11 19:12:03	JDHankle	It's honestly depressing to think that there are people who are like "HAML, YAML, and SASS are stuppiiddd"
2013-12-11 19:12:25	JDHankle	technology is like gay marriage
2013-12-11 19:12:25	twb	JDHankle: they ARE stupid

2013-12-11 19:13:09	twb	JDHankle: and because if stupidpants middleware uses something I don't have the resources to redo all their work just to avoid their stupids

2013-12-12 10:51:06	forcer	Sigma: I guess it would be nifty if this sanity check was removed on -O

2013-12-12 10:51:23	forcer	Sigma: And throw a warning otherwise
2013-12-12 10:51:24	rryoumaa	ijp: antarctica is closer

2013-12-12 10:51:40	b80905	do you find it inconvenient to press M-Backspace too or is it my keyboard that is not very ergonomic?
2013-12-12 10:51:44	Hodapp	rryoumaa: to use Java libraries you'll often have to grok Java documentation.
2013-12-12 10:52:11	forcer	b80905: Left hand on M, right hand on BS - it's about as convenient as backspace itself to me?

2013-12-12 20:13:30	wgreenhouse	mode-line, header-line, and the frame title all use the same format and in principle can represent the same data

2013-12-12 20:22:06	wgreenhouse	tEtra: it bears some traces of the old LispM OSes like Symbolics Genera.  but those systems depended on processor microcode to deal with Lisp efficiently, which RMS didn't think was a reasonable thing to try doing on off-the-shelf hardware of the '80s.  so Emacs does a lot of the interface work that a whole suite of applications did on a Symbolics or MIT machine.

2013-12-12 23:03:36	wgreenhouse	SamB: my memory of this stuff is murky, but I think it goes like this: various treaties to which .au is a party say that you don't get to prevent asylum applicants from remaining on your territory at least for long enough to apply for asylum, or prevent them from arriving by force.  but I believe the UN's position is that those treaties are only a codification of a preexisting norm, so
2013-12-12 23:03:36	wgreenhouse	e.g. some nationalistic government couldn't escape responsibility for complying just by renouncing them
2013-12-12 23:04:18	wgreenhouse	and yes, this does stem partly from WWII, in which Britain and the US played a rather despicable role in preventing Jewish and other refugees from docking, by force

2013-12-13 13:39:03	bazz	i may try this eclim thing

2013-12-13 13:41:33	wgreenhouse	sorry, it was just an ignorant third-hand suggestion, I don't do Java
2013-12-13 13:41:43	wgreenhouse	re "<bazz> it's really kind of a crime that emacs has such poor java support", I think that might be because Emacs/Lisp people's answer to dealing with Java is to invent Lisps to use in it, like Clojure and Kawa and Ceylon and ABCL
2013-12-13 13:41:53	webspid0r	^

2013-12-13 13:42:08	webspid0r	if not, then tough luck

2013-12-13 13:42:24	yates	modifying history is one advantage, and i don't see that being that important in my use-cases.
2013-12-13 13:42:37	jlf	wgreenhouse: i always find it surprising, though, that none of the clojure people have built a bridge between emacs and java's introspection support for this purpose.
2013-12-13 13:42:49	webspid0r	if not even vim has something good for it, then I doubt any free editor has
2013-12-13 13:42:55	wgreenhouse	jlf: yeah, I guess that is surprising

2013-12-13 13:45:35	wgreenhouse	mention of swank reminds me of a slime-related query: how might I get slime to use pcomplete or ido for symbol completion?  I find all of its completion options quite kludgey and distracting
2013-12-13 13:46:10	jlf	even the fuzzy match thing?
2013-12-13 13:47:14	wgreenhouse	jlf: maybe the fuzzy-matcher is behaving especially badly because I use a display-buffer-alist that tries to force most programs not to split windows.  I may need to make an exception for the slime fuzzy completions window

2013-12-13 14:19:53	jlf	yup, makes sense
2013-12-13 14:20:22	wgreenhouse	completion that doesn't use the minibuffer is the main thing I usually have to kludge around
2013-12-13 14:20:42	technomancy	can't think of very many platforms where 1MB is something you'd even think twice about
2013-12-13 14:21:01	wgreenhouse	and I can think of many environments that would make a much larger hello world, especially taking runtime into account
2013-12-13 14:21:09	wgreenhouse	this is like a 1980s reason not to learn lisp :)

2013-12-13 14:24:17	wgreenhouse	brihat: because the C program has hidden negative externalities

2013-12-13 17:04:08	ablepharus	i always wondered why noone fixed that gtk bug
2013-12-13 17:04:14	ablepharus	now i known
2013-12-13 17:04:47	wgreenhouse	it's because emacs is the only gtk application around that can actually be on two X displays, or an X display and a tty, at the same time

2013-12-13 17:04:53	wgreenhouse	so for everybody else it was okay to leave the behavior in case of "whoops, we lost a display" undefined
2013-12-13 17:05:34	ablepharus	lol
2013-12-13 17:05:58	ablepharus	i guessed that, but i wondered why no one of the emacs world jumped in
2013-12-13 17:07:34	bremner	gtk is not written in lisp.
2013-12-13 17:07:53	ablepharus	lol
2013-12-13 17:08:01	wgreenhouse	ablepharus: I imagine there are few individuals with commit rights at or influence over both gtk/gnome and emacs
2013-12-13 17:08:13	wgreenhouse	especially since gtk/gnome are no longer really gnu projects
2013-12-13 17:08:18	ablepharus	also who needs gtk
2013-12-13 17:08:50	ablepharus	inside emacs

2014-01-15 18:51:15	bpalmer`	let's copy cribbed autotools configuration files that originated in 1987 and were overly general even then.
2014-01-15 18:51:49	quotemstr	bpalmer`: ITYM sendmail.
2014-01-15 18:51:50	didi	There was ever only one autoconf.ac.
2014-01-15 18:51:59	quotemstr	Sendmail dates from an era where the format of the email address was supposed to be configurable.
2014-01-15 18:51:59	didi	Or .am?
2014-01-15 18:52:06	quotemstr	Half of sendmail is written in its configuration file.

2014-01-15 18:52:54	twb	That's like discussing the 1170
2014-01-15 18:52:58	twb	quotemstr: oh bang paths
2014-01-15 18:53:10	quotemstr	twb: Tools from the 80s were overly general because they needed that generality.
2014-01-15 18:53:23	twb	Meh.
2014-01-15 18:53:34	twb	It's not useful to discuss it

2014-01-15 18:53:52	quotemstr	It'd make this crap a lot easier.

2014-01-15 18:55:04	twb	Though TBH I have only used unbound's built-in DNSSEC support to the extent of it determining .org and .in were invalid and refusing to serve RRs from them until I disabled its DNSSEC support... :-/
2014-01-15 18:55:07	quotemstr	twb: Bind9 is the standard name server.
2014-01-15 18:55:11	twb	I didn't bother looking for the right answer.
2014-01-15 18:55:20	twb	quotemstr: in the same way that sendmail is the standard MTA?
2014-01-15 18:55:27	twb	And Windows is the standard OS?
2014-01-15 18:55:28	quotemstr	twb: Bind is maintained.
2014-01-15 18:55:42	twb	It's still awful

2014-01-15 23:25:34	wgreenhouse	johannesostling: but you might be seeing some autoomatic behavior if you installed a 3rd-party go-mode, especially if you borrowed a colleague's config for that mode as well

2014-01-15 23:47:46	wgreenhouse	HelperW: auto-save files (#foo.txt#) are removed automatically.  backup files (the ~ ones) implement a primitive form of version control; they are automatically disabled when emacs knows that it's insid ea version control repo and are not automatically deleted.  but you can change where they're saved or disable them completely.

2014-01-16 00:00:26	snogglethorpe	JamesNZ: I think one of the main problems when jumping like that is that your eye can lose track of where the cursor is; by default it repositions with the cursor at the exact center of the window, which makes locating the new position fairly simple
2014-01-16 00:00:51	kuanyui	loke_: But why `defvar` again?

2014-01-16 00:02:08	forcer	HelperW: M-x package-list-packages will give you a list of packages you can install. web-mode is likely among them. You can add package archives with more packages.

2014-01-16 00:03:31	JamesNZ	forcer: My perfect default would be for a minimum of 5 or so lines from the cursor to the edge of the window.
2014-01-16 00:03:46	snogglethorpe	JamesNZ: there's a variable taht sets that

2014-01-16 00:40:41	danjacka	Hi #emacs. When coding Python on a headless Linux VM, I install Emacs there and do X forwarding over SSH to the host machine.
2014-01-16 00:40:51	danjacka	I share my ~/.emacs.d from the host to configure Emacs on the VM just so.
2014-01-16 00:40:58	danjacka	Everything works (most importantly python-shell-send-buffer to interior Python processes).
2014-01-16 00:41:03	danjacka	My only gripe is it's a lot to setup every time I need a fresh VM.
2014-01-16 00:41:09	danjacka	So, just wondering, do other folks do the same? Any tips or suggestions for Better Ways?

I think he really likes using emacs configs that are almost entirely package.el packages, and then uses stuff like elpakit to make local package repos to more easily deploy the packages.  he also really likes Vagrant.
2014-01-16 00:45:33	hohum	actually that's kind of useful for me too
2014-01-16 00:45:56	hohum	I don't always have an Internet connection so I can't be bothered to use a single emacs install
2014-01-16 00:46:04	danjacka	loke_: I don't have an issue as such. Just curious how others configure their systems to use Emacs on VMs when they need interactive interpreters in comint buffers.

2014-01-16 12:31:13	tali713	:)
2014-01-16 12:31:13	P4C0	demi: I'll give zenburn a try, thanks
2014-01-16 12:31:17	wgreenhouse	urxvt is 256 colors ootb
2014-01-16 12:31:18	turbofail	urxvt should support that natively, as long as your TERM variable is set to xterm-256color
2014-01-16 12:31:37	wgreenhouse	no, xterm-256color is wrong
2014-01-16 12:31:42	auka	well what I tried was running tic eterm-color.ti and then placing that inside of .terminfo/e (it seemed to have generated it in .terminfo/65/
2014-01-16 12:31:44	auka	that didn't work
2014-01-16 12:31:47	demi	P4C0: I just mentioned zenburn because it works fine for me and probably your theme will looks mostly fine as well
2014-01-16 12:31:52	wgreenhouse	it has its own, rxvt-unicode-256color
2014-01-16 12:31:52	tali713	urxvt doesn't have its own 256 color TERM value?
2014-01-16 12:32:00	turbofail	wgreenhouse: oh, didn't know about that
2014-01-16 12:32:02	auka	then I just used the eterm-color and put that inside of .terminfo/e 
2014-01-16 12:32:05	auka	and that didn't work either.
2014-01-16 12:32:11	P4C0	wgreenhouse: where do I set that?
2014-01-16 12:32:13	tali713	auka: define "didn't work"
2014-01-16 12:32:15	wgreenhouse	tali713: yes, it does, rxvt-unicode-256color.  which sould not be overriden unless necessary
2014-01-16 12:32:29	auka	by didnt' work, I mean after I placed it in the directory I ran M-x term again
2014-01-16 12:32:31	P4C0	Is that URxvt.termName ?
2014-01-16 12:32:33	auka	and the strange characters were still there
2014-01-16 12:32:34	wgreenhouse	P4C0: you shouldn't be setting TERM at all, even though it is commonly offered [bad] advice.
2014-01-16 12:32:49	wgreenhouse	you should let TERM be automatically detected.
2014-01-16 12:33:04	tali713	auka: you were in a GUI frame of emacs, you ran M-x term RET it launched zsh, and you verified that $TERM was set too...?
2014-01-16 12:33:21	wgreenhouse	P4C0:  probably the reason your theme looks bad is that it actually requires even more than 256 colors.
2014-01-16 12:33:21	P4C0	wgreenhouse: thanks
2014-01-16 12:33:22	auka	I did
2014-01-16 12:33:23	demi	tali713: yes "thousands+ colors it isn't noticable" but mostly it looks pretty well (emacs -nw)
2014-01-16 12:33:23	auka	echo $TERM
2014-01-16 12:33:24	auka	it said
2014-01-16 12:33:25	auka	eterm-color
2014-01-16 12:33:48	turbofail	i have to set TERM in a bunch of situations.  like in gnome-terminal for instance
2014-01-16 12:34:00	tali713	demi: yeah, pretty good, not perfect if you compare side by side, but I agree, pretty good.

I personally feel glibc's behavior is not particularly safe.  To enable glibc behavior, one has to explicitly enable the MALLOC_GLIBC_COMPAT option."

2014-01-17 00:52:03	Sketch	bash acts differently depending on whether it's called as /bin/sh or /bin/bash
2014-01-17 00:52:06	taylanub	You can use '#!/usr/bin/env foo', it's more universally true that env is in /usr/bin than foo.  Disadvantage is, '#!/usr/bin/env foo -x' will not work, the OS will give the string "foo -x" as one argument to env so it'll search a program with that name.

2014-01-17 21:29:56	avshalom	sounds interesting, the course.
2014-01-17 21:29:56	sproingie	wonder if i still have my copy of CTM anywhere
2014-01-17 21:30:15	--	chandan_ is now known as chandan
2014-01-17 21:30:28	zacts	so what do you guys think?
2014-01-17 21:31:00	sproingie	zacts: it sounds like some good material
2014-01-17 21:31:11	avshalom	so lisp, java, and prolog?
2014-01-17 21:31:23	sproingie	oh it's by van roy himself.  he wrote mozart/oz and CTM
2014-01-17 21:31:37	zacts	I'm trying to decide between that course, or C. for this semester.
2014-01-17 21:31:39	avshalom	or does the class get taught in this mozart
2014-01-17 21:31:41	sproingie	he knows his shit
2014-01-17 21:31:42	avshalom	C
2014-01-17 21:31:50	zacts	(I haven't read SICP yet)
2014-01-17 21:32:09	sproingie	SICP's a good read too.  dry as the desert, but worth learning
2014-01-17 21:32:35	avshalom	i think you have to know C just to be in the business.  (not that I like it that much)
2014-01-17 21:32:49	sproingie	not remotely
2014-01-17 21:32:59	zacts	avshalom: but learning C involves more than just learning the language.
2014-01-17 21:33:05	sproingie	most people i've interviewed know java, maybe a smattering of C++
2014-01-17 21:33:19	sproingie	the folks who don't dig java go with ruby, js, and company
2014-01-17 21:33:21	zacts	it involves good design, abstractions, and development models.
2014-01-17 21:33:39	sproingie	i'm a polyglot, i've done 'em all and there's something to like about all of them
2014-01-17 21:34:00	zacts	but with C I'll also learn POSIX and UNIX
2014-01-17 21:34:08	sproingie	maybe
2014-01-17 21:34:09	avshalom	sproingie: i agree, but if you don't know C, then there's a very big problem.  (I know a dozen languages)
2014-01-17 21:34:27	sproingie	avshalom: many thousands of people get by without knowing C
2014-01-17 21:34:41	sproingie	heck, billions if you don't count programmers :)
2014-01-17 21:34:43	avshalom	sproingie: oh, i thought zacts cared
2014-01-17 21:34:43	zacts	avshalom: eventually I definitely will learn C, I'm just trying to decide how to go about learning how to program.
2014-01-17 21:34:50	avshalom	:-)
2014-01-17 21:35:05	sproingie	zacts: one book at a time
2014-01-17 21:35:29	sproingie	zacts: SICP is really a good read.  CTM is actually ... not very good at introductory material.  but maybe van roy's learned how to teach the basics since then

2014-01-17 21:36:31	zacts	I guess can I directly apply SICP to X language?
2014-01-17 21:36:35	sproingie	do you want to learn CS, or do you just want to build a career path for marketable skills?

2014-01-17 21:36:56	sproingie	SICP won't teach you anything *immediately* practical.  it will just have knock-on effects on all the code you write
2014-01-17 21:37:41	zacts	sproingie: both
2014-01-17 21:37:51	zacts	but I only will work on 'free software'
2014-01-17 21:38:07	sproingie	SICP itself is a tad annoying because it's *old*, and so it'll only work totally verbatim on MIT Scheme.  however, if you use mzscheme, you could probably get a lot of help from #scheme
2014-01-17 21:38:31	zacts	sproingie: I've heard success with guile.
2014-01-17 21:38:42	sproingie	i started doing it with guile, it definitely needs some translation
2014-01-17 21:38:51	zacts	ah ok, good to know.
2014-01-17 21:39:19	sproingie	the code works on any scheme, it's just sometimes the functions have *slightly* different names
2014-01-17 21:39:43	zacts	well, that's what irc/mailinglists are for.

2014-01-17 21:40:19	sproingie	haskell is an awesome language for learning concepts, but there's really not many good introductory tutorials
2014-01-17 21:40:31	avshalom	ok, don't make me invoke Tiobe
2014-01-17 21:40:35	sproingie	the first few chapters of learnyouahaskell.org are good.  gets into wall-of-text territory
2014-01-17 21:40:46	sproingie	avshalom: like i said, do you want to learn, or do you want to just work?
2014-01-17 21:40:51	avshalom	both
2014-01-17 21:41:14	sproingie	real learning involves shit that ain't practical for a long while
2014-01-17 21:41:39	avshalom	i agree, you have to know a lot of paradigms.  but a class in C will bring so much more contemporary breadth and depth

2014-01-17 21:42:14	sproingie	C is anything but "contemporary".  i would learn it as a second or third language.
2014-01-17 21:42:14	zacts	or I guess you mean a course on C.
2014-01-17 21:42:33	avshalom	it's No. 1 Tiobe
2014-01-17 21:42:33	sproingie	you definitely need to learn C at some point, no doubt about it.  you just don't need it first
2014-01-17 21:42:44	sproingie	i. don't. give. a. toss. about. tiobe.
2014-01-17 21:42:50	avshalom	and please don't tell me that No. 1 on tiobe means nothing
2014-01-17 21:43:08	avshalom	there's not a scheme or gule or lisp to be seen until 20!
2014-01-17 21:43:11	sproingie	actually some fictional language called C/C++ is likely #1 on TIOBE
2014-01-17 21:43:31	sproingie	even though modern C++ looks *nothing* like C
2014-01-17 21:44:00	priority_encoder	C++11 ?
2014-01-17 21:44:07	sproingie	even more divergent
2014-01-17 21:44:09	avshalom	anyway, my recommendation is to go C, then later in your career, try the others.  You sort of need to be good at something to appreciate the differences between imperative and functional
2014-01-17 21:44:40	zacts	sproingie: does SICP cover 'imperative' non-functional sequential programming as well?
2014-01-17 21:44:46	sproingie	i'm really surprised folks in emacs aren't recommending lisp

2014-01-17 21:45:08	zacts	I guess I want a well rounded introduction to computer science/programming concepts
2014-01-17 21:45:23	sproingie	you won't find it in one book
2014-01-17 21:45:38	sproingie	not one language either, really
2014-01-17 21:46:07	zacts	well, yes. but you have to start somewhere, so where should I really start?
2014-01-17 21:46:19	zacts	and then I'm done with this topic.
2014-01-17 21:46:29	sproingie	well my recommendation is SICP, flawed as it is
2014-01-17 21:46:41	zacts	and then what next?
2014-01-17 21:46:49	sproingie	you ask a dozen people, you'll get a dozen opinions
2014-01-17 21:47:03	sproingie	when you get halfway through SICP, you'll probably have a decent idea of what a good next step is

2014-01-17 22:32:53	zacts	why did languages, such as C, allow for such modification of state?

2014-01-17 22:34:09	sproingie	it still is very much close to the machine
2014-01-17 22:34:13	SamB	well, the way compilers are exploiting UB really

2014-01-17 22:36:16	zacts	wait, that question sounds not so great
2014-01-17 22:36:27	sproingie	it's like the convenience of global variables.  you don't have to think about it, it's always there.  pure functional languages make you think about the statefulness and everything it touches
2014-01-17 22:36:30	SamB	the state of using advantages?
2014-01-17 22:36:50	sproingie	truthfully, some things are just way easier to model with state
2014-01-17 22:36:53	SamB	sproingie: you mean you don't have to think about it anyway?
2014-01-17 22:37:44	avshalom	i think the neat stuff (in clojure) is about immutable data structures.  No one can change your payload on you.
2014-01-17 22:38:10	sproingie	going from SICP to clojure would not be at all a bad idea

2014-01-17 22:38:38	SamB	one functional thing I don't get is nixos
2014-01-17 22:38:55	sproingie	pure functional configuration management is an interesting experiment
2014-01-17 22:39:35	sproingie	should give you more flexibility with commutability and composability (think layers like docker)
2014-01-17 22:39:53	sproingie	tho truth be told, nixos is more masturbatory exercise than anything :)

2014-01-18 10:14:25	nf	I don't understand though, I put that thing you wrote into .emacs, then I use list-packages and install what? I don't see highlight-parenthesis
2014-01-18 10:15:16	nf	I tried that and it says Debugger entered--Lisp error (void-variable package-archies)

2014-01-18 10:15:59	nf	archives
2014-01-18 10:16:11	nf	I'm not sure what that means, I think this is a bit beyond me right now

2014-01-18 10:17:10	nf	Is there some sort of step by step I can use?
2014-01-18 10:17:11	forcer	You need to (require 'package) before using `package-archives'.

2014-01-18 13:14:28	redShadow	hi guys.. I'm looking for advice on adding nice support for both python 2 and python 3 editing.. the main issue I'm experiencing right now is w/ flake8 (when editing python3 I need to run it w/ a python3 interpreter..)
2014-01-18 13:15:04	redShadow	maybe it would be possible using some "projects" management thing (like eproject) but I'm not really familiar with any of them..
2014-01-18 13:15:10	ente	the problem is, I'm in fact not getting things done
2014-01-18 13:15:15	redShadow	anybody can point me in the right direction?
2014-01-18 13:15:38	ente	and figuring out org-mode and emacs sounds like a task for a week

2014-01-18 13:15:49	unic0rn	week?
2014-01-18 13:15:51	redShadow	(..I mean, using the project mgmt thing to configure a per-project interpreter / checker)
2014-01-18 13:15:59	ente	during which I do other stuff, like coding on other items of the todo lists
2014-01-18 13:16:00	Guest33554	ente: Make it a life long task.
2014-01-18 13:16:17	ente	unic0rn: yes, I'm slow
2014-01-18 13:16:30	unic0rn	you'll get used to emacs in one afternoon, if emacs is for you. configuring it to your needs will take a few days, but it'll be a few days of fun
2014-01-18 13:16:30	Guest33554	ente: Emacs is the journey.
2014-01-18 13:16:43	unic0rn	org-mode shouldn't take too long though
2014-01-18 13:16:51	ente	"figuring out" as in "figuring out enough of it that I don't want to headdesk with every keystroke"
2014-01-18 13:16:53	wgreenhouse	Guest33554: org isn't really a GTD tool, although it can be hacked into one.
2014-01-18 13:16:55	wgreenhouse	org is an outliner/structured document editor with some TODO and timetracking features
2014-01-18 13:16:55	wgreenhouse	it doesn't implement any of the cultish ideology. :)
2014-01-18 13:17:23	ente	I haven't read GTD (just looked up on wikipedia what the acronym stands for)
2014-01-18 13:17:33	unic0rn	ente: there's a 'cancel-whatever-i-just-did' combo ;P
2014-01-18 13:17:36	ente	so no, I won't be doing GTD
2014-01-18 13:18:01	unic0rn	in case a cat runs on your keyboard, obviously

2014-01-18 14:16:15	taylanub	I just noticed that these gibberish files have timestamps corresponding perfectly to times at which I'd start my remote X11 connections from work to home, so it must be nxproxy (remote X11 optimizing proxy that I use) that creates them.
2014-01-18 14:16:21	nicferrier	apols. I mean dlambda. not dflet.
2014-01-18 14:16:43	ente	hmm
2014-01-18 14:17:14	quotemstr	Anyway, here's my plan. Instead of allocating conses and strings in 2K blocks, we should be allocating them in 256K blocks directly from mmap.
2014-01-18 14:18:22	myself`	Uh, I forgot about the allegations of backdoors on OpenBSD.

2014-01-18 14:18:41	nicferrier	that would massively increase performance I think.
2014-01-18 14:18:42	quotemstr	nicferrier: We should then use jemalloc to get better fragmentation for the remaining small allocations.

2014-01-18 14:19:01	quotemstr	nicferrier: Yeah, and more importantly, fragmentation.
2014-01-18 14:19:07	nicferrier	it's some facebook thing?
2014-01-18 14:19:10	myself`	hodapp: Yeah. Din't you remember? There was an e-mail from someone who said they worked for the FBI.
2014-01-18 14:19:11	ente	myself`: I mean scheme code in the buffer that I'm writing right now, not prettyprinting something I evaluated in elisp before
2014-01-18 14:19:14	quotemstr	Basically, after dumping, we should never touch sbrk.
2014-01-18 14:19:16	nicferrier	why not just malloc in large chunks?
2014-01-18 14:19:18	quotemstr	nicferrier: FreeBSD originally.
2014-01-18 14:19:28	ente	sorry, I'm new and a bit lost :)
2014-01-18 14:19:28	nicferrier	that'll go down well with rms.
2014-01-18 14:19:58	SamB	oh, it turns out I'd accidentally pasted text into " *Minubuffer-0*" and that was getting displayed even though I didn't have an active minibuffer ...
2014-01-18 14:20:02	quotemstr	nicferrier: If it's already on the system, why not link to it? Maybe he can get the eglibc people to use an allocator better than what we shipped in Vista, which is a dream compared to dlmalloc.

2014-01-18 14:20:40	quotemstr	nicferrier: Anyway, the nice thing about jemalloc is that it has an sbrk mode. So pre-dump, we just allocate everything from sbrk the way we do today, and post-dump, we switch to allocating using a modern heap.
2014-01-18 14:21:08	quotemstr	nicferrier: (This lets us change allocation policy without touching unexec code.)
2014-01-18 14:21:12	nicferrier	quotemstr: well. it's worth a shot to see what people think. it sounds like it was a drop in replacement.
2014-01-18 14:21:24	quotemstr	nicferrier: I'll have to code it up after the current death march is over.
2014-01-18 14:21:29	nicferrier	but definitely we need to malloc in larger chunks.
2014-01-18 14:21:43	nicferrier	well, if you wait you'll get git.
2014-01-18 14:21:48	quotemstr	nicferrier: Also, I need a benchmark that provokes the kind of fragmention I observed (and that I saw mentioned previously on #emacs and dismissed)
2014-01-18 14:22:12	quotemstr	Also, OpenBSD these days is using a jemalloc-like pure-mmap allocator too. 
2014-01-18 14:22:40	nicferrier	well, go to it. they can either use it or shout at you.
2014-01-18 14:22:48	quotemstr	nicferrier: One insanely stupid thing we do today is to specifically prohibit dlmalloc from allocaitng using mmap even in caess where it thinks it's appropriate.

2014-01-18 14:23:13	nicferrier	probably  is a reason. wouldn't be surprised if it was politics.
2014-01-18 14:23:15	quotemstr	nicferrier: The fix is simple --- I've already coded it and it works fine --- but the fix requires that we allow emacs to dump only once on all platforms
2014-01-18 14:23:31	quotemstr	nicferrier: We don't save mmaped regions when we unexec, so pre-dump, all allocations have to come from the data segment, from sbrk.
2014-01-18 14:23:51	nicferrier	that's an issue.
2014-01-18 14:24:03	quotemstr	nicferrier: The Emacs core technically supports re-dumping an already-dumped Emacs, but this facility hasn't worked in years in real-life scenarios.

2014-01-18 14:24:37	quotemstr	nicferrier: We need to kill this feature so that after we start a dumped Emacs, we can know *for sure* that we're never going to dump again, so we can use mmapped memory
2014-01-18 14:24:43	nicferrier	dumping is a usefulish  idea. but hard to do right.
2014-01-18 14:24:54	quotemstr	Oh, I like dumping --- provided we do it once.

2014-01-18 14:25:21	SamB	the dump-again feature, I mean
2014-01-18 14:25:23	wasamasa	what exactly would dumping emacs be useful for?
2014-01-18 14:25:24	nicferrier	as you know... people used to use dumping for distribution.
2014-01-18 14:25:40	wasamasa	avoiding the flicker of the theme changing at startup?
2014-01-18 14:25:40	quotemstr	SamB: Yep. The GTK build breaks if you try that. NS doesn't work. Cygwin doesn't work. Windows probably doesn't work, but I haven't checked
2014-01-18 14:25:46	quotemstr	SamB: This is clearly a feature that people do not use.
2014-01-18 14:25:59	taylanub	At startup, Emacs's perception of colors is screwed up; stuff gets mapped to 8 colors, anyone know how I could make my library execute code *after* Emacs comes to its senses re. colors ?  There will never be a perfect solution since one can always connect to a daemon from other frames, but the first frame the user starts is a good heuristic ... hrm, I could look for a frame-creation hook and set some `done-that' variable perhaps, but a
2014-01-18 14:25:59	taylanub	cleaner way would be neat; after-init-hook won't do.
2014-01-18 14:26:00	SamB	NS refuses to try it, iirc
2014-01-18 14:26:05	quotemstr	wasamasa: It brings Emacs startup time down from 10 seconds to 250 milliseconds.
2014-01-18 14:26:10	nicferrier	yeah. I don't know anyone who actually uses it.

2014-01-18 15:25:48	taylanub	I had a similar problem while reasoning about optimization in Guile modules the other day, had to realize that in the end the module does not just contain compiled functions for (define (foo) ...) forms, it still also contains the thin wrapping code that actually binds the function somewhere, and the situation is funnier if you have (define foo (let ... (lambda ...)))
2014-01-18 15:26:33	taylanub	This is interesting in contrast to something like C, where the equivalent of "loading a module" executes no code and is purely compile-time.

2014-01-18 15:54:13	nicferrier	blackdog: that's quite a lot of work to do in a hook.
2014-01-18 15:54:58	nicferrier	blackdog: that's basically why emacs carries a special flag called buffer-modified-p that tells you whether the buffer is different from the disc. and kill already looks at that.

2014-01-18 15:55:31	blackdog	nicferrier: right. so couldn't you check that, then only diff if it says it's been modified?
2014-01-18 15:55:49	nicferrier	blackdog: if it's  been modified it's different.
2014-01-18 15:55:51	blackdog	i frequently have buffers that have been modified but reset back to their original state by the whitespace killer, for instance.
2014-01-18 15:56:10	blackdog	in fact, most of the time I try to kill a buffer then ask for a diff, there is no difference.
2014-01-18 15:56:41	nicferrier	'sup to you then.
2014-01-18 15:57:31	blackdog	so the way i would approach it is to use kill-buffer-hook?

2014-01-18 15:59:50	blackdog	nicferrier: so, hang on. is there no way to hook it so that it only runs diff if buffer-modified-p is true?
2014-01-18 16:00:00	quotemstr	In a brand new file in fundamental-mode, we should detect that the user types a shebang and change the mode appropriately.
2014-01-18 16:00:23	quotemstr	So new files could start in, say, tentative-fundamental-mode, and quicky switch to either real fundamental mode or something else
2014-01-18 16:00:26	nicferrier	blackdog: yes, of course. but diff is a program that takes a while to run. half a second?
2014-01-18 16:00:38	nicferrier	blackdog: on a big file maybe longer.
2014-01-18 16:00:52	blackdog	i'm happy with that for my purposes. most buffers i kill will be unmodified.
2014-01-18 16:01:05	blackdog	i just don't want to be asked a bunch of questions that the editor can work out for itself trivially.

2014-01-18 16:19:33	blackdog	sure. just trying to avoid doing things in a roundabout way if there's a direct path.
2014-01-18 16:19:54	nicferrier	but maybe an alternative is to do something when the buffer is edited with the things that you think are not altering it.
2014-01-18 16:20:04	nicferrier	you said there were whitespace things?
2014-01-18 16:20:47	blackdog	whitespace & autoformatting things, yes.
2014-01-18 16:21:12	blackdog	there are a few of them, i think kill-buffer is probably more direct
2014-01-18 16:21:12	nicferrier	I wonder if those things have hooks that you could run diff on and then you could mark the buffer unmodified
2014-01-18 16:21:30	blackdog	i'll have a look.
2014-01-18 16:22:05	nicferrier	or you could advise kill-buffer

2014-01-18 16:24:39	nicferrier	I don't like advice. it is annoying. but it's a tool in the box.

2014-01-18 16:28:43	blackdog	jlf: so that means there is no useful return value?
2014-01-18 16:28:46	nicferrier	blackdog: I'd go for shell-command-to-string
2014-01-18 16:29:05	jlf	it certainly strongly suggests it

2014-01-18 16:29:30	nicferrier	I am so going to write a library of better proc stuff
2014-01-18 16:29:31	blackdog	fair enough. diff does seem to have an awful lot of stuff going on.
2014-01-18 16:29:33	nicferrier	like pythons
2014-01-18 16:29:49	nicferrier	to know what you want you only need the status
2014-01-18 16:29:56	blackdog	yeah
2014-01-18 16:29:58	jlf	yes, that's why all of these editors implemented in haskell are taking the world by storm
2014-01-18 16:30:13	blackdog	jlf: i actually used yi for a bit :)

2014-01-18 16:30:55	jlf	the fact that you are here doesn't support the mighty weapon thing very well
2014-01-18 16:31:20	blackdog	there's a lot of history behind emacs, and a lot of packages.
2014-01-18 16:31:38	blackdog	my prod code is in haskell, and it's very pleasant to use.
2014-01-18 16:31:45	nicferrier	let's implement elisp in haskell.
2014-01-18 16:32:12	blackdog	nicferrier: could do, but what would be the point?
2014-01-18 16:32:46	nicferrier	don't believe you could.
2014-01-18 16:32:49	nicferrier	go on. prove it.
2014-01-18 16:33:16	jlf	have you considered the possibility that a significant reason emacs has such a long history and so many packages is the fact that one can accomplish things in it without donning type bondage?
2014-01-18 16:33:35	nicferrier	is that like ropes with nice writing on?
2014-01-18 16:33:52	blackdog	nicferrier: are you suggesting it's difficult to write an interpreter for an untyped dynamic language in a typed static one?
2014-01-18 16:33:53	jlf	idk, i've never been one for bondage
2014-01-18 16:34:06	nicferrier	jlf: really?

2014-01-18 16:36:34	blackdog	jlf: oh - it's a book by stephen jay gould. the suggestion is that a worse design that gets there first can beat out potentially better designs.
2014-01-18 16:36:43	nicferrier	roll up roll up. see people react badly to being told their empirically satisfactory system is worse than an alternative fantasy system.

2014-01-18 16:37:49	blackdog	I prefer typed systems, and am a bit uncomfortable with untyped ones. Purely personal, you can hack on whatever you like.

2014-01-18 16:38:21	nicferrier	not for much longer if johnw gets his way
2014-01-18 16:38:37	jlf	from an evolutionary perspective, the fact that "getting there first" is highly adaptive puts the lie to the argument that the losers were "better"

2014-01-18 16:42:36	pjb	All I'm saying is that like quaterly reports, evolution works on too small steps (still searching for a "missing link"?).  Intelligence and long term investment can perform better in more unstable or variable environments (and the universe doesn't look that uniform to me).
2014-01-18 16:43:10	blackdog	so i'm curious about development in elisp - do you usually have stuff just dump strings to (message ...), or write tests first, or ...?
2014-01-18 16:43:21	pjb	Yes.

2014-01-18 16:44:11	pjb	jlf: that said the universe has finite time. from -15e9 years to +15e9 years.  There's only a very small and finite number of star generations.
2014-01-18 16:44:34	jlf	small by what measure?

2014-01-18 16:44:46	pjb	like you can count them on your ten fingers!
2014-01-18 16:45:03	quotemstr	pjb: Galaxies are gradually merging together into larger and larger superclusters. Galaxy mergers destroy galaxy spiral structure.
2014-01-18 16:45:36	jlf	buzzkill
2014-01-18 16:45:39	quotemstr	When an elliptical galaxy forms through one of these traumatic mergers, you see a large initial burst of star formation as sound(!) waves propagate through the interstellar dust clouds in both galaxies, compressing them.
2014-01-18 16:46:12	quotemstr	But after that, star formation essentially stops since the galaxy's dynamic processes are disrupted. That's why most large elliptical galaxies are full of older, reddish stars. They're dead inside.
2014-01-18 16:47:32	quotemstr	Our galaxy will collide with Andromeda in about four billion years, and the collision will likely look a like M87, except smaller
2014-01-18 16:47:43	pjb	I've heard the Sun was a 2nd generation star.  When it'll go supernova, eventually its gases may collapse into a 3rd generation star.    Perhaps there'll be 4 generation in all during the lifetime of the universe.
2014-01-18 16:47:54	quotemstr	pjb: Third generation.
2014-01-18 16:48:10	quotemstr	Probably. I can tell by the spectral lines and having created a lot of star systems in my time.
2014-01-18 16:48:40	pjb	That doesn't leave a lot of time anyways for evolution to start again and try something else, if it fails.  Local optima are plain dead end for the evolution algorithm: the universe needs intelligent design!
2014-01-18 16:48:46	quotemstr	The first population of stars had essentially no elements heavier than lithium in them, since they formed immediately after the universe cooled sufficiently for matter to condense.
2014-01-18 16:48:55	blackdog	hm. is there a way to perform buffer operations without setting current-buffer?
2014-01-18 16:49:00	pjb	Let's design life forms for neutron stars and black holes.
2014-01-18 16:49:14	quotemstr	They only lasted a few billion years; then population II stars came along. Some are still around.
2014-01-18 16:49:19	blackdog	or is the standard way to save the current buffer, change it, then replace it when you're done?
2014-01-18 16:49:32	quotemstr	Our sun is a population I star (yes, it's numbered backwards) with a lot more "metal".
2014-01-18 16:49:51	jlf	blackdog: with-current-buffer.  `with-' is a common pattern for this sort of thing.
2014-01-18 16:50:00	quotemstr	blackdog: Some functions take buffers explicitly.
2014-01-18 16:50:05	quotemstr	blackdog: It's usually easier to just use with-current-buffer.
2014-01-18 16:50:06	blackdog	jlf: ah, cheers.
2014-01-18 16:50:25	blackdog	so you just get a stack of current buffers that don't interfere? That makes some sense.
