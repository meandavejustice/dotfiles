2013-05-22 14:40:11	emanuelefumagall	I expect not do have deep copies
2013-05-22 14:40:27	emanuelefumagall	yes, I agree on heap snapshot
2013-05-22 14:40:41	emanuelefumagall	quite unreliable
2013-05-22 14:40:43	coderanger	Even if it was a deep copy (it isn't) it doesn't matter, since a mark-and-sweep just looks for anything reachable from the root reference set
2013-05-22 14:40:51	emanuelefumagall	or maybe I cannot understand it
2013-05-22 14:41:17	paul_irish	you can try the new object allocation tracker in the chrome devtools: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39519/talks/devtools2013/index.html#26

2013-05-22 14:44:04	coderanger	emanuelefumagall: take one at startup, do X, take another, see what allocations remain
2013-05-22 14:44:20	paul_irish	coderanger: check the tool above, it's timebased so you can select the range that you want to diff against previous allocations

2013-05-22 14:48:57	emanuelefumagall	yes
2013-05-22 14:49:21	emanuelefumagall	one of the interesting finding was seeing requestAnimationFrame
2013-05-22 14:49:28	emanuelefumagall	to perform better than css transitions
2013-05-22 14:49:37	emanuelefumagall	at least on the STB

2013-05-22 14:50:10	paul_irish	yeah i hear the same thing about rAF. it depends on the implmentation.
2013-05-22 14:50:26	paul_irish	soon css animation will be off-thread in chrome desktop.
2013-05-22 14:50:29	emanuelefumagall	it's much better on the STB
2013-05-22 14:50:42	paul_irish	already is on chrome for android.
2013-05-22 14:50:45	emanuelefumagall	probably cause it tries to keep constant framerate
2013-05-22 14:50:53	emanuelefumagall	rather than going for 60fps
2013-05-22 14:51:08	emanuelefumagall	css transition are quite jerky
2013-05-22 14:51:23	emanuelefumagall	but there we're getting better with recent optimizations on webkit integration

2013-05-22 19:15:34	egghead	usually I have my views listen to my models and collections
2013-05-22 19:16:27	prolificgnosis	ok but to do that one would need to instantiate the view, where is the recommended place to instantiate a view per model
2013-05-22 19:16:33	_rgn	models or collections shouldn't know about views
2013-05-22 19:17:17	prolificgnosis	i call fetch in my document.ready function, my collection gets response in my parse method
2013-05-22 19:17:45	prolificgnosis	the view can either listen to a collection or a model
2013-05-22 19:17:53	egghead	prolificgnosis: you usually instantiate your views in your router

2013-05-22 19:19:14	prolificgnosis	ok so create router, which will execute when a specified url is accessed

2013-05-22 19:20:14	egghead	that's the gist of it prolificgnosis
2013-05-22 19:20:31	egghead	backbonejs.org recommends bootstrapping your data instead of doing .fetch
2013-05-22 19:20:47	egghead	but .fetch works just fine
2013-05-22 19:20:50	prolificgnosis	small steps ;)
2013-05-22 19:21:10	prolificgnosis	thanks for the clarification
2013-05-22 19:21:47	egghead	in the router you'd also want to tie your views to the dom
2013-05-22 19:22:03	prolificgnosis	ok that makes sense

2013-05-23 12:17:45	gllvr	oh… so making views hold onto this.options by default is going away?

2013-05-23 13:04:14	jshannon	i'm considering a Poll style app, with questions "groups" -> "questions" -> "options". There's not a lot of need to persist options as separate rows, so i was thinking about passing them as part of the question model and persisting them as a chunk of JSON in the table.
2013-05-23 13:05:14	jshannon	should work well, except for trying to reference an answer with some sort of unique ID so that i can compile answers later.
2013-05-23 13:05:28	jshannon	any suggestions on this?
2013-05-23 13:06:11	jshannon	as i was writing the question, maybe i can make the question model responsible for creating sequential IDs, and then the answer ID becomes questionID + answerID

I've been wondering if I should actually load my app - data & all - or instead instantiate views one at a time and fake ajax repsonses. Obv. running real responses on a test collection is slower but it feels much more complete

2013-05-23 19:26:40	robbiet480	Hi, i'm a total backbone n00b, building a map application. I need a dedicated map page that just shows a single set of coordinates via a google map. I have been banging my head against my desk for the last 3 hours or so, just trying to get a sane return from the server of a single modal. I got that working, but now I need to get a view going that outputs the map. I followed this tutorial: http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamenta

2013-05-24 12:01:47	egis	is this.remove() in view sufficient to remove view and all it's event listeners from dom?
2013-05-24 12:02:31	shanejonas	assuming you set up the listeners with `listenTo`

2013-05-24 12:03:46	egis	so listenTo is basically the same as on, just safer?
2013-05-24 12:04:37	shanejonas	doing `this.model.on('change')` is the same as `this.listenTo(this.model, 'change')`
2013-05-24 12:04:50	shanejonas	except in the first example it binds the listeners on the model
2013-05-24 12:05:31	shanejonas	the second example binds it on `this`.. and then `this.remove` eventually calls `this.stopListening()` which just removes everything that `listenTo` bound
2013-05-24 12:06:11	shanejonas	just more sane on where you are putting the listeners

2013-05-24 14:43:07	psykidellic	Hello, so I am trying to integrate requirejs with layoutmanager. My previous app without using require was working perfectly but now that I am trying to move, I cannot get my templates to render. I created a very simple app to demonstrate the issue. https://github.com/psykidellic/requirejs-layoutmanager - it seems that my template is being added without interpolation of the values.

2013-06-26 13:38:11	suppp	hi all, I have a question about backbone.js. I'm trying to understand how to bind a onclick event to a button, which is not a backbonejs view. Instead this button is rendered by the template into the html of a backbonejs View. so far i only find ways to bind events to views. do i really need to just make a simple button a View for this ?

2013-06-26 18:53:10	sirwan	i said what is your app ?
2013-06-26 18:53:19	sirwan	as in what does it do ?
2013-06-26 18:53:38	louism2__	sirwan: it searches and updates inventory
2013-06-26 18:53:56	sirwan	right, and dont you need an authenticated user to safely search and update inventory ?

2013-06-26 18:57:03	pontiki_	it looks like you're mixing things up a bit there
2013-06-26 18:57:50	pontiki_	if the core bit of your app is this Customer list, just build that to start, don't start with routes and that
2013-06-26 18:58:10	louism2__	pontiki: I definitely could be.  However, I know that I am getting the response from the server because when I log the resonse of fetch() I can see the data.  I just don't know how to get at that responseText attribute  http://i.imgur.com/zhrpgIh.png?1

2013-06-26 19:07:52	louism2__	sirwan: its a rails app
2013-06-26 19:08:01	sirwan	ok
2013-06-26 19:08:10	sirwan	im using rack sessions
2013-06-26 19:08:18	sirwan	id like to contact you when you get to authentication
2013-06-26 19:08:32	sirwan	well im using sinatra but it uses rack:sessions like rails does
2013-06-26 19:08:36	louism2__	sirwan: I would appreciate that.  Was that pretty big pain for you?
2013-06-26 19:08:45	sirwan	it is now
2013-06-26 19:08:46	sirwan	yes
2013-06-26 19:08:56	sirwan	and thats why im warning you about it
2013-06-26 19:09:12	sirwan	im not sure if i should just stick to ERB server scripting instead of backbone
2013-06-26 19:09:36	sirwan	authentication with backbone involves big planning with sending, reading, back tokens for EVERY api request you make
2013-06-26 19:09:42	louism2__	sirwan: without knowing the exact flow, can't you just grab the cookie using jquery and then send it along with the backbone request?
2013-06-26 19:09:49	sirwan	because its REST, you cannot read a session from backbone
2013-06-26 19:10:25	sirwan	yeahs, but then I'd have to compare taht cookie to the session on Rack , right ?

2013-06-26 19:12:19	louism2__	sirwan: but at the end of the day you still have to authenticate each request right?  Rack is still uses http right?
2013-06-26 19:12:33	sirwan	by rack i just mean the sessions
2013-06-26 19:12:40	sirwan	for example if you look at this cookie
2013-06-26 19:13:18	sirwan	requiest header to http://grid.to/api/user/current
2013-06-26 19:13:26	sirwan	on the network tab: has a cookie

2013-06-26 19:13:50	louism2__	sirwan: yep
2013-06-26 19:14:05	sirwan	so I send that back to the server … ok
2013-06-26 19:14:18	louism2__	sirwan: yeah
2013-06-26 19:14:30	sirwan	what do I do with it on the server exactly ?
2013-06-26 19:14:44	sirwan	just check it exists on as a session on the server ?

2013-06-26 19:16:08	louism2__	sirwan: there really is not concept of a persistent session with http (sorry if I am seem to be talking down).  So every request needs to be authenticated.  The cookie is just an encrypted representation of your authentication info.
2013-06-26 19:16:26	sirwan	aha ok
2013-06-26 19:16:31	sirwan	ok
2013-06-26 19:16:46	sirwan	how do I unencrypt that cookie to find the auth info
2013-06-26 19:16:59	sirwan	i guess i can use jquery.cookie to send it

2013-06-26 19:17:55	louism2__	sirwan: yeah, I haven't looked into how backbone handles cookies but I would imagine that the cookie is sent with every request already
2013-06-26 19:19:10	louism2__	sirwan: by default
2013-06-26 19:19:10	louism2__	sirwan: what language are you coming from?
2013-06-26 19:19:10	sirwan	ruby

2013-06-26 19:19:10	sirwan	not rails
2013-06-26 19:19:10	sirwan	its the same
2013-06-26 19:19:10	sirwan	sinatra is just a micro-framework but uses the same internal library
2013-06-26 19:19:13	sirwan	or 'middleware'
2013-06-26 19:19:33	sirwan	as rails, same middleware called 'rack' which handles things like sessions etc

2013-06-26 19:25:45	sirwan	out of curiousity is the cookie sent as json ?

2013-06-26 19:26:08	louism2__	sirwan: yeah, check the request header on the server and I would assume that if you created a cookie at some point on the client it is automatically sent.  I'm pretty sure that the browser handles everything surrounding cookies with requests
