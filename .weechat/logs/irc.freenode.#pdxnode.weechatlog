2013-07-25 14:16:47	ericholscher	Is there a good way to do something similar to python **kwargs in javascript?
2013-07-25 14:17:19	 *	ericholscher is broken in the head
2013-07-25 14:23:42	Wraithan	ericholscher: kwargs doesn't exist
2013-07-25 14:24:02	Wraithan	if you are looking for *args you can use func.apply(this, argsArray)
2013-07-25 14:24:29	Wraithan	`this` being the `this` that will be available inside of the function, if you don't have/need it, set it to `null`
2013-07-25 14:33:52	ericholscher	:)
2013-07-25 14:33:57	ericholscher	javascript breaks my brains
2013-07-25 14:34:03	Wraithan	:)
2013-07-25 14:36:51	jerrysv	faster if it's null
2013-07-25 14:37:10	 *	Wraithan didn't know that
2013-07-25 14:37:19	jerrysv	now you know
2013-07-25 14:37:23	jerrysv	and knowing is half the battle
2013-07-25 14:39:00	chrisdickinson	jerrysv: but why?
2013-07-25 14:39:25	jerrysv	chrisdickinson: i can point to the jsperf session at jsconf, but probably due to all of the setup
2013-07-25 14:40:28	Wraithan	The more you know¤ª"˜¨¯¯¨˜"★
2013-07-25 14:40:34	 *	chrisdickinson searches
2013-07-25 14:40:50	chrisdickinson	it's still gotta set up a `this` for the function -- window or null
2013-07-25 14:40:58	chrisdickinson	(depending on the strict-ness of the function)
2013-07-25 14:41:15	chrisdickinson	again, there really needs to be a javascript performance zen garden :|
2013-07-25 14:42:56	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: this is like when we were discussing that python code in the starcraft channel
2013-07-25 14:43:44	Wraithan	x is slightly faster than y, but honestly they run so fast and infrequently that neither matters!
2013-07-25 14:47:35	chrisdickinson	http://jsperf.com/apply-null-vs-apply-obj
2013-07-25 14:47:50	chrisdickinson	jerrysv: ^^
2013-07-25 14:51:03	chrisdickinson	it appears that it's faster in this case if it's an object?
2013-07-25 14:51:24	chrisdickinson	though i suppose that could be the "this" inside the function
2013-07-25 14:52:13	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: similar results in firefox
2013-07-25 15:00:06	jerrysv	chrisdickinson: i hope the jsconf stuff gets released soon

2013-07-25 15:39:50	dlmanning	chrisdickinson, Wraithan: Is this not for the same reason that .bind() is slow?

2013-07-25 15:40:14	dlmanning	:)
2013-07-25 15:40:53	Wraithan	I am not as good at JS performance as I am with python or c/c++
2013-07-25 15:41:06	chrisdickinson	bind is slow (likely) because you're doubling the number of function calls and ensuring that both the outer and inner function call have to use argument adaptors
2013-07-25 15:41:11	dlmanning	I read something the other day that was saying .bind(this) is slow because it produces [Native Code] instead of a js function
2013-07-25 15:41:29	chrisdickinson	doubtful, bind is still implemented as JS i do believe.
2013-07-25 15:41:47	 *	dlmanning digs
2013-07-25 15:41:49	chrisdickinson	and often, [native code] functions are actually just JS functions with a special bit set on them to mask them
2013-07-25 15:42:35	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/v8natives.js#L1727
2013-07-25 15:43:14	Wraithan	btw, writing C/C++ is hard when you've gotten used to dropping semi colons
2013-07-25 15:43:26	dlmanning	Wraithan: Easy solution
2013-07-25 15:43:36	Wraithan	dlmanning: don't write C/C++?

2013-07-25 15:44:15	dlmanning	Wraithan: Use semicolons, like a gentleman ;P
2013-07-25 15:44:19	chrisdickinson	if i were primarily writing C/C++ i would probably go for a more traditional style
2013-07-25 15:44:23	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: http://esdiscuss.org/topic/why-is-bind-so-slow
2013-07-25 15:44:24	Wraithan	yea
2013-07-25 15:44:25	chrisdickinson	but i write python
2013-07-25 15:44:39	Wraithan	yeah, python/js for the most part
2013-07-25 15:44:47	Wraithan	but C/C++ was super easy for me to pick back up
2013-07-25 15:45:03	Wraithan	Happy to find that
2013-07-25 15:45:19	Wraithan	My recent increase in JS has partially helped with that
2013-07-25 15:45:52	chrisdickinson	:D
2013-07-25 15:47:15	dlmanning	Wraithan: It's like Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Always use semicolons, because it's better"
2013-07-25 15:47:31	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: hah!

2013-07-30 11:35:51	chrisdickinson	breathalyzer
2013-07-30 11:36:18	chrisdickinson	various ways to control a nodecopter (google glass head orientation, twilio dialtone controller)
2013-07-30 11:36:48	donpdonp	heh. neat. i was hoping for one of these http://is.gd/4YtKC7
2013-07-30 11:36:59	chrisdickinson	thoward might have you covered
2013-07-30 11:37:23	donpdonp	were any actual quadcopters in attendance?

2013-07-30 11:44:20	jden	re twilio drone, I was talking with carter and was disappointed to hear you don't get fine-grained control of DTMF events
2013-07-30 11:44:34	jden	ie, I want a keydown/keyup, not just a keypress
2013-07-30 11:44:53	chrisdickinson	yeah i overheard that

2013-07-30 11:45:17	jden	it would be pretty niche I suppose
2013-07-30 11:46:02	jden	could maybe hack some node pbx stuff
2013-07-30 11:46:24	jden	and just use a dired SIP provider rather than twilio
2013-07-30 11:46:30	jden	s/dired/direct
2013-07-30 11:46:54	hackygolucky_	I should really try using our API with dukesam's nodecopter :D
2013-07-30 11:47:01	hackygolucky_	it'd be a fun FF project.

2013-07-30 13:16:45	Wraithan	adafruit appears to have nicer protoboards though so I might actually go see about using theirs
2013-07-30 13:31:45	Wraithan	http://paul.cx/public/dramatic.gif
2013-07-30 13:40:31	hackygolucky_	dukesam: yeah I could always see how hilariously awful it would be to command a nodecopter via push
2013-07-30 13:41:29	dukesam	sounds like a lot of hitting walls
2013-07-30 13:41:39	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: only need one command: flip

2013-07-31 10:32:21	hackygolucky_	yup yup.
2013-07-31 10:33:03	hackygolucky_	VERY frustrating. I'm still convinced chrisdickinson could take a short sabbatical and crank it out way quicker, but he'd have to want to do that :P

2013-07-31 10:34:39	Wraithan	I feel that way about most programming problems... given a short sabbatical, chrisdickinson can solve our problems.
2013-07-31 10:34:46	chrisdickinson	untrue!
2013-07-31 10:34:57	chrisdickinson	at most i am able to change your problems :D

2013-07-31 10:36:16	Wraithan	So because chrisdickinson is the devil he should take a code sabbatical

2013-07-31 12:55:05	chrisdickinson	that's what i'm doing
2013-07-31 12:55:13	chrisdickinson	and of course pip is throwing a fit
2013-07-31 12:55:18	chrisdickinson	because pip
2013-07-31 12:55:19	Wraithan	upgrade pip
2013-07-31 12:55:24	chrisdickinson	it's not pip's fault.
2013-07-31 12:55:27	Wraithan	new pip is way better than old pip
2013-07-31 12:55:27	chrisdickinson	well

2013-07-31 21:04:56	thoward	it's a handy kit to have around.
2013-07-31 21:05:11	Wraithan	my kit has basically all of those but the 68k ones :/
2013-07-31 21:05:38	thoward	such is life.
2013-07-31 21:05:43	Wraithan	which I'm going to need for a fancy logrithmic light sensor
2013-07-31 21:05:48	thoward	you know, you can stack resistors to get the value you want
2013-07-31 21:06:27	Wraithan	yeah, but I'm going to want a minimal footprint once I nail down how all the hardware works for this little sensor unit
2013-07-31 21:07:32	thoward	sure. but for prototyping while you wait.. you can build it from what you've got
2013-07-31 21:08:08	Wraithan	sensor wont be in stock for another 5-10 days, so waiting on it anyway
2013-07-31 21:08:09	thoward	in series they are additive. Rs=R1+R2 in parallel Rp=(1/R1 + 1/R2)^-1
2013-07-31 21:08:11	Wraithan	I do appreciate that

2013-08-01 10:32:29	s5fs	also, i thought ulimit did fuckall in osx, have to change some /etc/launchd.conf or something
2013-08-01 10:32:52	jerrysv	wait, pdxnode moved up to jive?
2013-08-01 10:33:10	chrisdickinson	s5fs: it keeps it from whining about not enough open files
2013-08-01 10:33:17	chrisdickinson	the EMFILE song and dance
2013-08-01 10:33:34	s5fs	chrisdickinson: do you have an /etc/launchd.conf?
2013-08-01 10:33:42	chrisdickinson	nope
2013-08-01 10:34:04	s5fs	chrisdickinson: something like this  http://superuser.com/questions/302754/increase-the-maximum-number-of-open-file-descriptors-in-snow-leopard
2013-08-01 10:34:40	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i had to do this recently for a couple of 10.8 boxes for riak, otherwise it would just poop out after running for about a minute
2013-08-01 10:34:51	chrisdickinson	i don't get any errors on `ulimit -n 2000`
2013-08-01 10:35:38	s5fs	ulimit never gave me any errors, it just never actually worked
2013-08-01 10:35:54	chrisdickinson	if i rerun `ulimit -n` it'll give me 2000 now
2013-08-01 10:35:57	s5fs	little differences between osx and linux make me nervous haha
2013-08-01 10:36:29	s5fs	I still recommend you create the conf file, reboot, and see how it goes. "worked for me" and all that
2013-08-01 10:36:43	s5fs	but dang, i can't say i've seen any similar error from npm, but i'm on another platform
2013-08-01 10:36:54	chrisdickinson	k. `ulimit` eliminated the EMFILE problem for me -- and it appears to be localized to browserify
2013-08-01 10:37:01	s5fs	woo!
2013-08-01 10:37:10	chrisdickinson	but emfile was never the problem, unfortunately :)
2013-08-01 10:37:21	s5fs	boo :(
2013-08-01 10:38:22	s5fs	did your ulimit take effect immediately or did you have to reboot? which release are you on?
2013-08-01 10:38:28	chrisdickinson	it's immediate
2013-08-01 10:38:42	chrisdickinson	osx 10.7.5
2013-08-01 10:39:00	s5fs	weird! totally wasn't working for me on 10.6 i think, i kinda wanna give it another try
2013-08-01 10:39:02	chrisdickinson	so, newest browserify works. i'm guessing that somewhere in there, a dep wasn't pegged.
2013-08-01 10:39:13	chrisdickinson	life is weird and solutions are strange
2013-08-01 10:39:49	s5fs	and sea critters are ugly
2013-08-01 10:52:54	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: 'ulimit is bumped' yay random troubleshooting
2013-08-01 10:53:55	chrisdickinson	yeah, ulimit became a really big thing with npm install as of 0.10
2013-08-01 10:54:03	chrisdickinson	otherwise you get silly EMFILE errors
2013-08-01 10:54:22	chrisdickinson	"npm err: npm is working too quickly!"

2013-08-02 14:20:55	hackygolucky_	so.
2013-08-02 14:21:06	hackygolucky_	Got the sensor reading in-console
2013-08-02 14:21:20	hackygolucky_	but the Object is always 0inches away, read null
2013-08-02 14:21:33	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: code?
2013-08-02 14:21:35	hackygolucky_	for the ping setup https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five/blob/master/docs/ping.md
2013-08-02 14:23:07	Wraithan	reading their lib
2013-08-02 14:23:38	Wraithan	hmmm their implementation appears right
2013-08-02 14:24:14	hackygolucky_	we've bridged the echo and trigger like we talked about last night, and I also saw a thread where nexxy and rwaldron recommended the same thing
2013-08-02 14:24:50	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: hah, glad real hardware people felt the same way about how to deal with that
2013-08-02 14:25:23	hackygolucky_	yup yup. That and rwaldron basically said use another friggin' piece of hardware because apparently this ultrasonic sensor is stupid.
2013-08-02 14:27:48	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: if you wanna come over to mozpdx I can give you my ping to use for your demo
2013-08-02 14:28:10	Wraithan	then for the final installation you can get your own or something

2013-08-05 11:15:22	Wraithan	don't and just write a good readme?
2013-08-05 11:15:34	Wraithan	because your module should only be 1-2 functions

2013-08-05 14:29:26	faddah	is the github address to add suggested speaker talks to pdx node meetings https://github.com/pdxnode ?
2013-08-05 14:31:03	hackygolucky_	faddah: https://github.com/PDXNode/pdxnode but a new repo needs to be added for requested speaker talks. It doesn't exist yet.
2013-08-05 14:31:40	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: new repo? I was thinking just open an issue or PR against a different directory
2013-08-05 14:31:42	Wraithan	or something
2013-08-05 14:31:50	hackygolucky_	faddah: Aron talked about adding this repo at the last meeting.
2013-08-05 14:32:17	hackygolucky_	faddah: nope, moving forward we'd like it in a repo. I can do myself if you'd rather.
2013-08-05 14:32:39	hackygolucky_	oops, meant that for Wraithan :)
2013-08-05 14:32:50	hackygolucky_	and by repo I mean directory

2013-08-05 14:36:49	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: nope. Link? :)
2013-08-05 14:37:28	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2013-August/001486.html
2013-08-05 14:38:02	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I can distill it later tonight
2013-08-05 14:38:10	hackygolucky_	cool beans.
2013-08-05 14:39:41	faddah	so, again - do i wait until there are august-2013 & september-2013 folders and the post it there? if i post a talk and it doesn't get done one month, do i copy it into the next month, or do you folks have it do that automatically with all talks that haven't been done yet?
2013-08-05 14:40:01	Wraithan	faddah: oh you are talking about a proposal that you are going to talk about?
2013-08-05 14:40:22	hackygolucky_	faddah: there just needs to be a 'requested talks' directory
2013-08-05 14:40:31	faddah	Wraithan - yes, kinda.
2013-08-05 14:40:48	hackygolucky_	if you want to submit a talk, then you would create a folder for September, as the August presentation  night already happened
2013-08-05 14:40:56	hackygolucky_	via the instructions on the README
2013-08-05 14:41:04	faddah	will do
2013-08-05 14:41:23	faddah	thank you Wraithan & hackygolucky_.

2013-08-05 14:42:14	Wraithan	haha
2013-08-05 14:42:30	Wraithan	faddah: which is what we thought you meant at first
2013-08-05 14:42:58	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: I just mostly don't want to detract from all the work thoward and others do for the conference.
2013-08-05 14:43:12	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: ah yea
2013-08-05 14:43:19	faddah	Wraithan & hackygolucky_ : what is mozpdx? is that going to take up all of the september meet-up?
2013-08-05 14:43:21	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I just can't ever say it straight
2013-08-05 14:43:33	hackygolucky_	faddah: that's the Mozilla Portland office.
2013-08-05 14:43:33	Wraithan	faddah: mozilla's portland office
2013-08-05 14:44:06	faddah	hackygolucky_ & Wraithan - so we're meeting there instead of jive? or they're coming to give presentations?
2013-08-05 14:44:25	Wraithan	faddah: meeting at mozpdx instead of Jive
2013-08-05 14:46:35	hackygolucky_	pdxnode doesn't have an official home for now. So we take what gracious hosts will give us.
2013-08-05 14:48:20	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: devtools may sponsor it
2013-08-05 14:48:24	Wraithan	so there should be pizza
2013-08-05 14:48:30	hackygolucky_	oooooh
2013-08-05 14:48:30	Wraithan	can't promise beer
2013-08-05 14:48:50	hackygolucky_	beer is nice but unnecessary
2013-08-05 15:00:35	faddah	that homeless brother is my friend

2013-08-06 13:40:11	chrisdickinson	it'd be nice to have a tool that you could say what style you wanted to have your code in, and then give it the output of `git diff yourbranch…master`, and it would fix all of the lines you changed / wrote

2013-08-06 15:50:00	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: Yeah, I maybe sounded a little sharper with mikeal than I meant it. Twitter is bad for that
2013-08-06 15:50:55	dlmanning	My thing was just that there's a much larger circle of node users than those who come to the conferences and spend their days idling in node channels
2013-08-06 15:51:10	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: I think it's fair. It was a pretty assumptive statement. As if streams is ubiquitous and easy to digest.
2013-08-06 15:51:16	hackygolucky_	yup yup
2013-08-06 15:51:55	dlmanning	I understand that everyone who uses node API's is in some sense "using streams"
2013-08-06 15:52:37	dlmanning	But that's a bit like saying everyone who turns on the operating system is using assembly language
2013-08-06 15:52:47	dlmanning	*just a bit* ;)
2013-08-06 15:55:12	dlmanning	If I were mikeal rogers and I existed in a community inundated with people who spend most of their time using and thinking about node, I might forget that there are a lot of people out there just using express to build websites
2013-08-06 15:56:57	hackygolucky_	indeed.

2013-08-06 19:10:02	dlmanning	... well... you can download Backbone and jQuery 2.0 and require() them both
2013-08-06 19:10:43	dlmanning	Then write a simple Backbone view below, browserify it all and load it in a browser
2013-08-06 19:10:50	dlmanning	Or you could do the same with beefy

2013-08-06 19:12:12	dlmanning	If you just want to observe what browserify does, then make a few files (a.js, b.js, c.js) and have them require one another in some fashion
2013-08-06 19:12:38	dlmanning	Then create a main.js or something that requires the files you created and browserify it

2013-08-06 20:17:11	Wraithan	I am less of one of those quantities, human or reasonable, not sure which.

2013-08-06 20:18:28	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: you should convince erkstyn to get the burger and then get a bit

2013-08-06 20:19:10	chrisdickinson	it's more fun to call them draculas.
2013-08-06 20:19:13	Wraithan	ah
2013-08-06 20:19:17	Wraithan	i could buy that
2013-08-06 20:19:37	chrisdickinson	at least, for me.
2013-08-06 20:22:10	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: yeah, saw that video linked on twitter ealier today. Need to watch it later
2013-08-06 20:23:02	dlmanning	Possibly I will compel Amy to watch it with me before bed, should help her fall right to sleep :)

2013-08-06 20:24:24	chrisdickinson	i read the pacific rim wikia wiki
2013-08-06 20:24:31	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: omg
2013-08-06 20:24:34	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Oh no doubt, I started it earlier and it looked fun
2013-08-06 20:24:34	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: that movie
2013-08-06 20:24:41	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: ZOMG
2013-08-06 20:24:43	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-08-06 20:24:58	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: when that movie hits beer theaters, I'm going to see it again and again and again
2013-08-06 20:24:58	chrisdickinson	i really didn't like the movie that much, but there's so much wiki-bait
2013-08-06 20:25:05	Wraithan	...
2013-08-06 20:25:07	dlmanning	Wraithan, chrisdickinson: I read Elder Scrolls lore articles
2013-08-06 20:25:31	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: you look like a friend of mine, but my friend would never say anything that stupid.
2013-08-06 20:25:33	chrisdickinson	so, to rephrase: loved the art direction, really disliked the script.

2013-08-06 21:54:57	Wraithan	Yeah, pretty stoked
2013-08-06 21:54:59	hackygolucky_	context. Context can be good.
2013-08-06 21:55:00	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-08-06 21:55:22	Wraithan	will be 3 cameras, one facing the audience, one facing the speaker directly and one angled at the speaker
2013-08-06 21:55:36	Wraithan	then you can mix and match
2013-08-06 21:55:50	hackygolucky_	geez. Wow.
2013-08-06 21:56:24	Wraithan	And we have audio from the room and audio from the podium
2013-08-06 21:56:38	Wraithan	not sure if we can capture both but only play the podium over the speaker
2013-08-06 21:56:46	Wraithan	I'll have to play with the software
2013-08-06 21:57:12	Wraithan	Best part of that though is if the speaker doesn't repeat the question we should still be able to capture it
2013-08-06 22:01:32	Wraithan	I'm pretty stoked
2013-08-06 22:08:29	dlmanning	That's gonna be really badass
2013-08-06 22:14:50	Wraithan	Zandr, the guy who gets all our AV working is awesome
2013-08-06 22:15:05	Wraithan	I wonder if the system can capture the TV too
2013-08-06 22:15:10	Wraithan	so we can mix it together
2013-08-06 22:16:38	dlmanning	That would be really neat

2013-08-07 09:49:42	ericholscher	Wraithan: you should have him write a blog post about your AV setup
2013-08-07 09:53:15	ericholscher	it sounds pretty legit
2013-08-07 09:54:00	Wraithan	hmmm
2013-08-07 09:54:01	Wraithan	yea
2013-08-07 09:54:08	Wraithan	I'll see if he can't toss that on a moz blog
2013-08-07 09:54:15	Wraithan	or at least on his own blog and give me a link
2013-08-07 09:55:13	Wraithan	I really like him, he has not only been happy to answer all my questions about the AV setup, but has started coming to me to tell me about features he forgot and things he can build into our setup if I want, etc

2013-08-07 11:48:47	chrisdickinson	answer was: probably not

2013-08-07 11:48:53	chrisdickinson	i think summer is taking it out of me
2013-08-07 11:48:56	chrisdickinson	i love it
2013-08-07 11:49:00	Wraithan	lol
2013-08-07 11:49:00	chrisdickinson	but i get tired so much earlier.
2013-08-07 11:49:03	dlmanning	It is rough, isn't it
2013-08-07 11:49:09	dlmanning	What with the sun and such
2013-08-07 11:50:05	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I was going to ask you about .on('data', ...) and piping
2013-08-07 11:50:15	dlmanning	Then I played around with it awhile
2013-08-07 11:50:20	dlmanning	and it's weird
2013-08-07 11:55:24	dlmanning	I thought that the .on('data') would consume the chunks, but it does not
2013-08-07 11:55:41	dlmanning	They continue to flow through the pipe as happily as ever
2013-08-07 11:56:31	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: in streams1, 2, or 3? :)
2013-08-07 11:56:41	dlmanning	all of the above
2013-08-07 11:58:27	dlmanning	Now in streams2, if you first setup a pipe, and then declare an .on('data') and attempt to .pause() the stream within the event handler, it will throw an error
2013-08-07 11:58:53	dlmanning	In streams3, this is fine
2013-08-07 11:59:40	dlmanning	What I had not realized is that in streams2 .on('data') does not force the stream into compatibility mode if a pipe is already flowing
2013-08-07 12:00:28	dlmanning	Rather an event is emitted when the pipe pulls data chunks through
2013-08-07 12:00:44	dlmanning	This means you can easily spy on your stream
2013-08-07 12:20:37	chrisdickinson	interesting
2013-08-07 12:21:28	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: so basically, if there's a reader attached to a readable via pipe, and it's called for a "read", 'data' events (and listeners) will get called -- and attaching the listener doesn't trigger flowing mode?
2013-08-07 12:22:10	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: That's how it appears to me
2013-08-07 12:22:21	chrisdickinson	weird

2013-08-07 12:44:03	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: no, not really
2013-08-07 12:44:25	hackygolucky_	hrm, okay.
2013-08-07 12:44:33	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: It would be a footnote, but it is an answer to Jessie's question
2013-08-07 12:44:55	hackygolucky_	ah
2013-08-07 12:45:50	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: It's one particular situation in which .on('data') doesn't coerce the stream into flowing mode
2013-08-07 12:46:22	hackygolucky_	so that isn't a common situation?
2013-08-07 12:47:36	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: It's kind of an oddball thing to be doing anyway
2013-08-07 12:47:56	dlmanning	piping AND adding an event listener
2013-08-07 12:48:26	chrisdickinson	well
2013-08-07 12:48:27	s5fs	for fun and profit!
2013-08-07 12:48:32	chrisdickinson	wellll.
2013-08-07 12:48:35	dlmanning	I think most cases it would serve would be better implemented by piping to multiple streams
2013-08-07 12:48:39	chrisdickinson	`once('data'`
2013-08-07 12:48:44	chrisdickinson	might be a valid use.
2013-08-07 12:49:00	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: yeah, that
2013-08-07 12:49:04	chrisdickinson	as a "on first read do this, ignore on subsequent reads"
2013-08-07 12:49:55	dlmanning	Honestly I am not entirely satisfied with my conceptual framework on all this
2013-08-07 12:52:57	dlmanning	In particular I'm confused about under which circumstances .on('data') will cosume the chunk
2013-08-07 12:53:10	dlmanning	cosume/consume
2013-08-07 12:57:18	dlmanning	On the other hand I think that "Consume the Chunk" would make a great band name
2013-08-07 12:57:24	chrisdickinson	this is probably the bit i like the most about simple-streams
2013-08-07 12:57:55	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: The fact that they aren't based on EventEmitter ?
2013-08-07 12:58:01	chrisdickinson	well, that
2013-08-07 12:58:08	s5fs	dlmanning: a goonies tribute band
2013-08-07 12:58:17	dlmanning	s5fs: YES

2013-08-07 12:58:40	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work s5fs!
2013-08-07 12:58:53	chrisdickinson	but mostly that they're very clear, conceptually.
2013-08-07 13:00:09	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: but existing modules
2013-08-07 13:00:43	chrisdickinson	but existing modules?
2013-08-07 13:00:53	dlmanning	yeah
2013-08-07 13:01:06	chrisdickinson	existing modules exist, yes.
2013-08-07 13:01:09	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-08-07 13:01:10	dlmanning	indeed
2013-08-07 13:01:22	chrisdickinson	yeah, everything's built to use node's streams.
2013-08-07 13:01:57	dlmanning	I mean, that's exactly why streams(n) is the way that it is
2013-08-07 13:02:14	chrisdickinson	right
2013-08-07 13:02:24	dlmanning	Even issacs has said he thinks that basing streams on EventEmitter was a mistake
2013-08-07 13:02:33	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-08-07 13:02:51	chrisdickinson	doesn't preclude my liking simple-streams for that reason :)
2013-08-07 13:03:16	chrisdickinson	transform streams get you about 95% of the way to a good api anyway.
2013-08-07 13:03:16	Wraithan	I'd probably end up wrapping some of my streams with EventEmitters even if they weren't based on them
2013-08-07 13:03:19	dlmanning	Oh, of course not

2013-08-07 13:05:03	dlmanning	My thing is what to tell people who are new to node about streams
2013-08-07 13:05:50	Wraithan	The only reason I got into streams was chrisdickinson showing me through so it was really simple to incorporate
2013-08-07 13:08:33	chrisdickinson	i tend to say "use through" :)
2013-08-07 13:08:45	dlmanning	yeah
2013-08-07 13:09:05	dlmanning	And you know I love through, and that I love you
2013-08-07 13:09:07	dlmanning	:)
2013-08-07 13:09:08	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-08-07 13:09:37	Wraithan	Now what keeps me away from streams2/other stuff isn't the complication in implementation but the worrying about making my code work with other stream libraries

2013-08-07 13:10:02	chrisdickinson	right
2013-08-07 13:10:05	chrisdickinson	streams2 isn't going away
2013-08-07 13:10:14	chrisdickinson	and Transform is pretty much set in stone
2013-08-07 13:10:22	dlmanning	Neither is streams1
2013-08-07 13:10:25	chrisdickinson	it's not as nice of an api to write against as through, imho
2013-08-07 13:10:43	chrisdickinson	but it's probably the place to migrate towards
2013-08-07 13:10:57	chrisdickinson	probably.
2013-08-07 13:11:21	dlmanning	I think it's good to use Stream.Transform if you're making your own transform stream that's meant to be instantiated
2013-08-07 13:11:48	dlmanning	If it's a one-off thing, why not use through
2013-08-07 13:12:19	dlmanning	Sort of like anonymous vs. named functions
2013-08-07 13:12:26	dlmanning	sort of
2013-08-07 13:15:51	chrisdickinson	i'd use transform like i use through
2013-08-07 13:23:06	dlmanning	var tr = new require('stream').Transform(); tr._transform = function () {}; someStream.pipe(tr);
2013-08-07 13:23:08	dlmanning	like that?

2013-08-07 15:09:02	faddah	s5fs - might be pinging you for further help.
2013-08-07 15:09:06	s5fs	go for it
2013-08-07 15:09:44	s5fs	i'm fighting with git atm, had an intern mergefuck something due to a total lack of training
2013-08-07 15:10:10	s5fs	he's using some fucking gui tool so i have no idea what he did
2013-08-07 15:10:18	s5fs	nor does he
2013-08-07 15:12:46	s5fs	so yeah, annoyed.
2013-08-07 15:13:10	faddah	s5fs: oy. ask hackygolucky_ about my github struggles yesterday. i was using the mac github app, so i relate. it does sync, pull & push, but no compare and pull request, which is probably the cause of your clusterf*ck. solution: 1) fork. 2) clone local. 3) make desired changes 4) pull request through web ui in github.
2013-08-07 15:14:07	hackygolucky_	part of the problem with the guis is that they abstract away so much that you can be a serious hazard without knowing it.
2013-08-07 15:14:08	faddah	s5fs & hackygolucky_ - support mail from github says they are considering adding compare and pull requests to mac os x github app in the future.
2013-08-07 15:14:17	s5fs	faddah: nah, i had a kid merge an old branch back into my 'develop' branch. we're not using github at all.
2013-08-07 15:14:23	hackygolucky_	git!
2013-08-07 15:14:26	hackygolucky_	funsies!
2013-08-07 15:14:38	hackygolucky_	s5fs: reverting isn't working?
2013-08-07 15:14:52	s5fs	hackygolucky_: part of the problem with GUIs is that it obscures what's really happening
2013-08-07 15:14:55	faddah	hackygolucky_ werd. but your idea of “funnies” and mine are decidedly … uh… different.  :P  ;)
2013-08-07 15:15:14	s5fs	hackygolucky_: revert won't cut it, i do have commits i want to keep and blah blah, it's a mess.
2013-08-07 15:15:18	faddah	hackygolucky_ funnies, pardon. damn you, autocorrect!
2013-08-07 15:15:32	s5fs	i mean, i can roll back pre-merge but i still have to pluck his good commits and place them elsewhere before reintegrating
2013-08-07 15:15:48	hackygolucky_	Oh I've had no end in fun/terror with git as a newb.
2013-08-07 15:15:56	s5fs	kid got nervous and started whacking away at buttons in an attempt to unfuck things
2013-08-07 15:16:05	s5fs	which always fixes things
2013-08-07 15:16:06	hackygolucky_	s5fs: oh boy.
2013-08-07 15:16:10	hackygolucky_	always!
2013-08-07 15:16:39	s5fs	i was against the hire, he's just a high school kid. boss picks him up for the summer and then leaves for europe so it's now officially my problem
2013-08-07 15:17:07	hackygolucky_	sabotaging you right before he goes back to school, eh?
2013-08-07 15:17:10	s5fs	i advocated cli-based training end-to-end and was shut down, so now i've got to re-train him correct
2013-08-07 15:17:27	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i have no idea why we've got kids hanging around here, i'm busy as shit and have no support, this is NOT helpful.
2013-08-07 15:17:39	s5fs	I lost my PM and another dev and was given two high schoolers.
2013-08-07 15:17:47	s5fs	way uncool

2013-08-07 15:19:32	hackygolucky_	yurp.
2013-08-07 15:21:26	chrisdickinson	s5fs: are you familiar with git reflog?

2013-08-07 15:23:18	chrisdickinson	ah
2013-08-07 15:23:24	chrisdickinson	if you have access to his machine it might be handy.
2013-08-07 15:23:35	chrisdickinson	it shows you all of the operations that resulted in a HEAD change
2013-08-07 15:23:41	chrisdickinson	and all of the corresponding hashes
2013-08-07 15:23:48	chrisdickinson	so you can get back to the hash before life was horrible
2013-08-07 15:24:14	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i have no idea how long his system has been borked, that's most of the struggle
2013-08-07 15:24:18	chrisdickinson	oh ):
2013-08-07 15:24:21	s5fs	he's not pulling before pushing
2013-08-07 15:24:28	s5fs	he's making commits across all branches
2013-08-07 15:24:31	s5fs	it's crazy
2013-08-07 15:24:48	s5fs	like how often do you stash something, jump to a totally unrelated branch, apply/commit/push?
2013-08-07 15:25:03	chrisdickinson	sober or after a few?
2013-08-07 15:25:09	s5fs	just untrained
2013-08-07 15:25:19	s5fs	ultimately it's my fault, its my project
2013-08-07 15:25:28	chrisdickinson	oh, i meant were you asking how often i did that? :)
2013-08-07 15:25:29	s5fs	i should've taken more time to explain our process, WHY we do things, etc.
2013-08-07 15:25:33	s5fs	haha!
2013-08-07 15:25:59	s5fs	reflog is awesome
2013-08-07 15:26:04	s5fs	i'll brb i'm gunna dig thru his history
2013-08-07 15:26:09	chrisdickinson	i heartily recommend pointing him at http://pragprog.com/book/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git

2013-08-07 15:37:19	s5fs	right on

2013-08-08 09:54:43	hackygolucky_	justinabrahms: yeah I was gonna let you know that I forgot it.
2013-08-08 09:58:51	s5fs	bah, the kid may not even be in the car
2013-08-08 09:59:29	s5fs	that's some crazy future shit though, messaging everyone about a particular person
2013-08-08 10:01:04	jondelamotte	That was pretty insane. I didn't realize they could do something like that.
2013-08-08 10:01:41	s5fs	no technical reason not to
2013-08-08 10:01:56	s5fs	but then again, tech is crazy
2013-08-08 10:02:00	jondelamotte	Sure, but I didn't even know the facility was built in
2013-08-08 10:02:24	s5fs	i guess it's opt-in on some devices, i didn't get the alert though so i'll never save that poor girl
2013-08-08 10:02:29	jondelamotte	I thought it was some kind of spam at first
2013-08-08 10:02:34	s5fs	it is, it is
2013-08-08 10:03:05	s5fs	i'm totally curious under what conditions this feature can be used though

2013-08-08 10:03:49	jondelamotte	err, uncle...
2013-08-08 10:04:26	s5fs	it seems possible that license plate scanners could be paired with onstar to remotely disable vehicles with unpaid parking tickets
2013-08-08 10:05:14	s5fs	i wonder how long it'll be until we just get tickets while driving and have them paid before we get home. would we just factor speeding tickets into the overall cost of travel?
2013-08-08 10:05:16	jondelamotte	Interesting, that seems possible. Is onstar still alive and kicking?
2013-08-08 10:05:24	s5fs	last i heard, yes.
2013-08-08 10:06:19	s5fs	anyways, enough soapbox dystopia
2013-08-08 10:06:23	jondelamotte	I've been really digging the "waze" app lately, have you seen that? It a navigation app with tons of social driving data, it's amazingly useful while driving
2013-08-08 10:06:32	jondelamotte	haha, truth

2013-08-08 10:07:13	s5fs	iirc, microsoft had patented some navigation process that would customize your driving directions in order to have you pass advertisers restaurants/businesses
2013-08-08 10:07:41	jondelamotte	Sounds like something they would do...
2013-08-08 10:07:49	s5fs	totally funky right?
2013-08-08 10:07:58	s5fs	ad-based route determination
2013-08-08 10:08:31	s5fs	waze is interesting!
2013-08-08 10:08:42	jondelamotte	It works like a charm, i was really impressed
2013-08-08 10:10:38	s5fs	the live map is weird and keeps listing traffic events in seattle
2013-08-08 10:11:51	jondelamotte	Yeah their webapp sucks

2013-08-08 10:35:49	dlmanning	So the Amber Alert thing was recently implemented by carriers as a result of some legislation that took effect earlier this year
2013-08-08 10:36:30	hackygolucky_	yup yup
2013-08-08 10:36:57	hackygolucky_	I thought that the alert broadcast system was being 'ported' over to all smartphones starting 2014
2013-08-08 10:37:03	hackygolucky_	as well.
2013-08-08 10:38:39	dlmanning	It's kind of like the emergency broadcast system
2013-08-08 10:38:56	dlmanning	Do they still do that? I haven't watched regular TV in years
2013-08-08 10:39:06	s5fs	beats me
2013-08-08 10:39:17	s5fs	they don't on streaming services, amirite?
2013-08-08 10:39:23	hackygolucky_	I thought they do, but I'm in the same boat.
2013-08-08 10:39:58	s5fs	"weather alert in a location you're nowhere near"
2013-08-08 10:40:34	dlmanning	I used to live in Oklahoma, sometimes the weather alerts are relevant :)
2013-08-08 10:42:03	dlmanning	I saw a thing the other day where the FBI can remotely activate the microphone on some Android phones
2013-08-08 10:44:11	jerrysv	the amazing thing is that i didn't get an amber alert on my phone
2013-08-08 10:44:20	jerrysv	maybe because it was in do not disturb mode?

2013-08-08 16:16:22	s5fs	anyone know of a reasonable way to lock screen orientation on a mobile device? seems like it's not really supported.
2013-08-08 16:40:52	faddah	s5fs - android or iOS? or are you trying to do this through html5/css/javascript w/ cordova/phone gap?
2013-08-08 16:52:02	s5fs	faddah: both platforms, no phonegap.
2013-08-08 16:52:25	s5fs	I'm not certain it's a hard-and-fast requirement, spec is a banana peel
2013-08-08 16:55:10	faddah	s5fs - so you're coding in _both_ objective-c/cocoa-touch/iOS _and_ java/android?
2013-08-08 16:55:38	s5fs	faddah: no, nothing native at all, pure web.
2013-08-08 16:56:17	s5fs	I have one layout that I wish to keep fixed in a particular layout bc the customer doesn't want to pay for an alternate view
2013-08-08 16:58:38	faddah	i tried searching for it at both the open source apache-cordova project and at adobe's phone gap, but at one or both of those places is a grid showing what native features to each platform (android, iOS, blackberry OS, etc.) you have through cordova/phone gap. thought that might help. maybe try searching there? i'd do it, but i gotta go clean up stuff and get ready for pdx web & design meet-up at web trends tonight.
2013-08-08 16:59:41	s5fs	yeah, I already have the UI done, I just wanna see if I can stop it from rotating on mobile devices. i'm looking for a simple approach and would rather not slap a bunch of big libraries at the problem. if that's what it takes, its probably out of scope.
2013-08-08 17:00:47	faddah	that chart would tell you if they have access to a lock rotation feature.
2013-08-08 17:00:51	faddah	gotta go.
2013-08-08 17:00:57	s5fs	faddah: good point, thanks for your help!

2013-08-12 12:50:09	chrisdickinson	i apparently call `Array#push`, `Function#call`, and `RegExp#test` a lot
2013-08-12 12:50:23	chrisdickinson	oh geez, i'm dumb, one second
2013-08-12 12:50:26	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-08-12 12:52:13	chrisdickinson	well, actually, ignore the "i'm dumb" bit for now. but only for this moment. i thought i could refine the results by adding a "call >" selector above my "lookup > id + id[name="name"]" bit
2013-08-12 12:53:51	dlmanning	I also get Array.push, Function.call and RegExp.test as top three
2013-08-12 12:54:10	hackygolucky_	nice.
2013-08-12 12:55:48	dlmanning	however I think a lot of that is monolithic libraries outside of node_modules in my directory structure
2013-08-12 12:56:09	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: porque gist rather than a real repo?
2013-08-12 12:56:20	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: because i was doing it quickly
2013-08-12 12:56:23	Wraithan	ah
2013-08-12 12:56:28	chrisdickinson	it'll be a real repo someday soon
2013-08-12 12:56:29	Wraithan	hub create
2013-08-12 12:56:31	Wraithan	:)
2013-08-12 12:56:32	chrisdickinson	nope
2013-08-12 12:56:35	Wraithan	ezpz
2013-08-12 12:56:35	chrisdickinson	nope nope nope
2013-08-12 12:56:38	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-08-12 12:56:51	chrisdickinson	in my case: `init-repo`
2013-08-12 12:56:51	Wraithan	yup yup yup yup yup
2013-08-12 12:58:17	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Did you see my link to Javascript Allonge?
2013-08-12 12:58:20	chrisdickinson	yep
2013-08-12 12:58:46	dlmanning	I really think you'd like this one
2013-08-12 12:58:51	dlmanning	maybe
2013-08-12 12:58:59	dlmanning	I mean... you might hate it... that's cool
2013-08-12 12:59:28	chrisdickinson	i haven't gotten the chance to peruse it, but yeah -- thanks for the link!
2013-08-12 12:59:50	dlmanning	But the author does an introduction to Javascript from very much the same approach as a math text
2013-08-12 13:00:05	chrisdickinson	interesting
2013-08-12 13:00:11	dlmanning	It's like building layers of theorems
2013-08-12 13:00:33	dlmanning	It's like a poem
2013-08-12 13:00:57	dlmanning	(it's possible that I'm being excessively enthusiastic)
2013-08-12 13:00:59	chrisdickinson	i just picked up a copy of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Compiler_Design over the weekend at hawthorne powell's
2013-08-12 13:01:23	dlmanning	Yeah, I saw the picture you posted of the cover. That looks trippy
2013-08-12 13:01:28	chrisdickinson	it's a lot of fun to read!
2013-08-12 13:02:46	chrisdickinson	it's probably a super obvious thing to everyone else, but within the first 30-40 pages it touches on triple codes, which, as it turns out, are a really great way to flatten an AST into instructions
2013-08-12 13:03:12	chrisdickinson	(and for some reason i had never really even thought about that possibility in terms of compiling an AST)
2013-08-12 13:03:47	chrisdickinson	(i may be misremembering the term "triple codes")
2013-08-12 13:04:31	dlmanning	What are they? (the entity herein referred to as "triple codes")?
2013-08-12 13:05:26	hackygolucky_	second this question ^^
2013-08-12 13:06:44	hackygolucky_	Regardless of whether that book would be of any value to me at this stage, it sounds like an awesome book.
2013-08-12 13:07:36	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Same thing as a three address code?
2013-08-12 13:07:55	chrisdickinson	yes! three address code
2013-08-12 13:07:58	chrisdickinson	!m dlmanning
2013-08-12 13:07:59	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work dlmanning!
2013-08-12 13:08:30	 *	dlmanning has tremendous powers of googling
2013-08-12 13:08:58	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: I recommend engineering a compiler if you are reading compiler books
2013-08-12 13:09:02	dlmanning	So it's a way of encoding an operation
2013-08-12 13:09:03	chrisdickinson	but it's kind of bizarre -- there are definitely newer versions out -- the purple dragon book is the newest i do believe
2013-08-12 13:09:22	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: yep. you can then go and "backpatch" things like labels / jumps
2013-08-12 13:09:45	chrisdickinson	iirc nitro uses three address codes
2013-08-12 13:09:46	dlmanning	RESULT = OPERAND1 X OPERAND2
2013-08-12 13:09:52	chrisdickinson	(as its IR)
2013-08-12 13:10:19	dlmanning	The result and the two operands are the three addresses
2013-08-12 13:11:00	chrisdickinson	http://wingolog.org/archives/2011/09/05/from-ssa-to-native-code-v8s-lithium-language
2013-08-12 13:11:21	chrisdickinson	lithium (in v8) is a 3ac
2013-08-12 13:11:27	chrisdickinson	(or close to?)
2013-08-12 13:11:51	dlmanning	Oh that's awesome
2013-08-12 13:12:15	chrisdickinson	http://wingolog.org/archives/2011/10/28/javascriptcore-the-webkit-js-implementation JSC has a two address code where the result is implicitly stored in the first operand?
2013-08-12 13:12:23	chrisdickinson	but yeah
2013-08-12 13:12:26	chrisdickinson	super neat
2013-08-12 13:12:29	chrisdickinson	want to build a js compiler
2013-08-12 13:12:32	chrisdickinson	or something
2013-08-12 13:12:53	chrisdickinson	the book i have was printed in 79
2013-08-12 13:13:09	chrisdickinson	and talks at length about SNOBOL and FORTRAN
2013-08-12 13:13:41	chrisdickinson	(well, not at length, but definitely contextualizes things "in terms of" snobol/fortran and I think one other that is escaping me. pascal?)
2013-08-12 13:13:42	dlmanning	Wonder if you could use the encodings to establish relationships between two AST's

2013-08-13 09:55:27	nvcexploder	is it mostly trad or sport?
2013-08-13 09:59:17	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: ew ):
2013-08-13 09:59:35	chrisdickinson	so, the behavior is "memory leak by default"?
2013-08-13 09:59:37	justinabrahms	chrisdickinson: yup. it feels like C++ land, managing pointers etc
2013-08-13 09:59:56	chrisdickinson	(also thanks for the info -- the way it was phrased I had wondered if he was aware of some DOM event listener leak I wasn't)
2013-08-13 10:00:31	justinabrahms	there are layers on top of backbone (marionette, thorax, etc) which handle the lifecycle for you
2013-08-13 10:00:33	justinabrahms	but is generally lame.
2013-08-13 10:01:16	justinabrahms	in our base View class: https://gist.github.com/justinabrahms/ae76c45711e9e0b50521
2013-08-13 10:01:28	justinabrahms	where initialize is the backbone object constructor
2013-08-13 10:02:49	chrisdickinson	so, out of curiosity, are views instantiated once at the beginning or as one transitions into an active view?

2013-08-13 10:11:03	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: if you ever wanna come climbing with us...
2013-08-13 10:11:18	hackygolucky_	we play it very safe. We're a bunch of chickens.
2013-08-13 10:11:58	nvcexploder	it sounds fun. I haven't been in forever - I would need to get a new harness as mine is for 130 pound me.
2013-08-13 10:12:45	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: you could use justinabrahms' as he doesn't climb much these days, but it might be big on you.
2013-08-13 10:13:19	nvcexploder	I want to get Andrea to go again too … when she was climbing she was much less afraid of heights
2013-08-13 10:13:27	nvcexploder	do y'all do any multi-pitch climbs?
2013-08-13 10:13:44	justinabrahms	I'd say that my harnest is for someone 230+
2013-08-13 10:14:12	justinabrahms	or more appropriately 36" waist
2013-08-13 10:14:16	justinabrahms	(or more)
2013-08-13 10:14:33	nvcexploder	I'm working on it justinabrahms, just little further - (on the weight, on the waist I'm totally there already)
2013-08-13 10:16:12	justinabrahms	:) well you're more than welcome to use my harness. No rubbing your body on sharp rocks though.

2013-08-13 10:24:33	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: nah, never tried a multi-pitch
2013-08-13 10:24:51	hackygolucky_	there are some good beginner ones at Smith, but I think for that I'd prefer a guide teaching me.
2013-08-13 10:27:44	nvcexploder	multi-pitch climbs are rad and horrifying.

2013-08-13 11:12:41	nvcexploder	they're $20 … you can pre-order through Fandango

2013-08-13 11:15:25	nvcexploder	yep
2013-08-13 11:15:52	justinabrahms	dlmanning: object.on, as we've only just recently upgraded to the version that supports listenTo
2013-08-13 11:16:16	dlmanning	justinabrahms: Cause I think listenTo can solve a lot of your memory management woes
2013-08-13 11:16:30	justinabrahms	that's possibly true, thought event listeners are only one piece of the puzzle.
2013-08-13 11:16:43	justinabrahms	You also have to have a system of view registration for correct teardown

2013-08-13 12:56:53	hackygolucky_	oh! I remember you saying you were coming and I was holed up in ops corner apparently not saying hi to many people

2013-08-13 12:57:48	hackygolucky_	I missed some other friends as well.
2013-08-13 12:58:04	donpdonp	hackygolucky_: ha. i was too busy trying to figure out where the crowd came from to make much of an effort to say hi.
2013-08-13 12:58:11	hackygolucky_	Thanks for reminding me donpdonp that I can be *better* :)
2013-08-13 12:58:32	donpdonp	hackygolucky_: so existential :)
2013-08-13 12:58:32	hackygolucky_	donpdonp: man, you announce free booze and all kinds of hoodlums show up, heh.
2013-08-13 12:58:49	hackygolucky_	I was happy so many kids came. Surprised, but nice. It was a good balance and no one got silly.
2013-08-13 12:59:27	donpdonp	hackygolucky_: indeed. the space is huge. i liked the kids presence too but i did get nervous a couple times when teenagers armed with nerf guns walked out of the nerf area
2013-08-13 12:59:29	hackygolucky_	well, no one pulled the bad kind of silly. Nerf guns running amok were great.
2013-08-13 12:59:42	hackygolucky_	oh, I didn't see teens with nerfs.
2013-08-13 12:59:55	scottjab	there was that one kid that was in war paint and underoos by 6

2013-08-13 13:01:11	hackygolucky_	one day, we will have our climbing wall up to the third floor. I dream of a day I must climb to get to work.

2013-08-14 11:18:27	dlmanning	Like mongohq with a CMS frontend that people can edit?
2013-08-14 11:24:52	faddah	so anyone think anything about elon musk's idea to stick us all in car sized pneumatic tubes and propel us at 700 mph from l.a. to s.f. in 30 min.? aside from the obvious if something goes wrong, you're a flattened human pizza part…  http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268789/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=SF7nV8Ip

2013-08-14 12:21:38	s5fs	dlmanning: haha, i found a bug in safari where if you're using self-signed certs then websockets doesn't work right and socket.io sucks it
2013-08-14 12:21:59	s5fs	long story short, reinstall with linux and all is well
2013-08-14 12:22:28	dlmanning	s5fs: I'm just trying to get a simple node client/server pair to connect with a certificate I've generated

2013-08-14 12:23:39	s5fs	dlmanning: interesting, i'm curious to hear how you solve it. in java it's a mess to use self-signed certs as a client
2013-08-14 12:23:50	dlmanning	Yay!
2013-08-14 12:23:59	s5fs	in fact, self-signed certs are becoming such an issue that i'm considering dropping ssl entirely
2013-08-14 12:25:03	dlmanning	Just throws this everytime: Error: DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT
2013-08-14 12:26:07	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: do you have rejectUnauthorized: false?
2013-08-14 12:26:57	chrisdickinson	(also, did you specify a custom https agent?)

2013-08-15 08:44:37	nvcexploder	s5fs: apparently very subtle feedback.
2013-08-15 08:45:34	s5fs	nvcexploder: i whispered my thoughts into the dewey morning air, hopefully they found his ear
2013-08-15 08:45:55	nvcexploder	s5fs: :)
2013-08-15 08:47:16	nvcexploder	s5fs: wanna build a node + [arduino,beaglebone, raspberry pi] + awesome home automation system?
2013-08-15 08:48:03	nvcexploder	(or anyone, for that matter - justinabrahms I know you want to (maybe if we switch to Go?))
2013-08-15 08:48:52	justinabrahms	I'm not sure what I'd even automate w/ my home.
2013-08-15 08:49:09	s5fs	nvcexploder: sure, i have a need for some common components anyways
2013-08-15 08:49:31	justinabrahms	The only thing that comes to mind is that I'd like to know when my plants need watering and for that to show up on a web service that's shown on an ipad mounted to a wall in my house.
2013-08-15 08:49:32	s5fs	nvcexploder: have an architecture in mind?
2013-08-15 08:50:02	s5fs	justinabrahms: swap a sensor and that's basically what i demo'd at nodepdx
2013-08-15 08:50:11	nvcexploder	yep
2013-08-15 08:50:26	justinabrahms	s5fs: what's the approximate cost of one unit of those?
2013-08-15 08:50:27	nvcexploder	(to s5fs's sensor swap thing)
2013-08-15 08:50:31	s5fs	justinabrahms: http://pokemedia.com/nodepdx/2013/#/1
2013-08-15 08:51:03	s5fs	justinabrahms: total cost on that build, excluding the aeroponic system, was around $100-125 depending on how much crap you already have (wall warts, usb cables, etc)
2013-08-15 08:51:28	s5fs	justinabrahms: but most of the cost was in the raspberrypi, hanging additional wireless sensors is around $30/ea
2013-08-15 08:51:31	justinabrahms	Doesn't seem worth $100 to me to know if my $15 house plant has water.
2013-08-15 08:51:54	s5fs	justinabrahms: yeah, my original talk title was "how to solve a $10 problem with $150 in gear"
2013-08-15 08:52:46	nvcexploder	s5fs: I have little ideas, and things that I'd like it to do, but no architecture yet
2013-08-15 08:53:27	s5fs	nvcexploder: slap up a repo and we can start generating issues
2013-08-15 08:53:32	nvcexploder	word
2013-08-15 08:53:58	s5fs	indoor or outdoor?
2013-08-15 08:54:02	s5fs	wired or wireless?
2013-08-15 08:54:10	s5fs	j5 or roll your own arduino sketch?
2013-08-15 08:54:34	s5fs	how many nodes?
2013-08-15 08:54:56	s5fs	for me, i'm thinking: indoor, custom sketch, up to a dozen sensor nodes
2013-08-15 08:55:04	justinabrahms	if you guys don't have the chrome cloud-to-butt plugin, you're doing it wrong.
2013-08-15 08:56:53	s5fs	CaaP (Cloud-as-a-Pooper)
2013-08-15 08:57:14	justinabrahms	it just randomly places "cloud" with "butt" or "the cloud" with "my butt"
2013-08-15 08:57:25	justinabrahms	which is super jarring to see in context, hence the humor
2013-08-15 08:57:34	s5fs	justinabrahms: haha, that's way less nasty that i expected.
2013-08-15 08:57:55	justinabrahms	#10 http://i.imgur.com/25omLTU.png
2013-08-15 08:57:58	s5fs	i envisioned a little device that sampled your stool and sent nutritional data back to advertisers to improve targeting
2013-08-15 08:58:02	 *	justinabrahms is also 14 years old.
2013-08-15 08:58:04	justinabrahms	eew.
2013-08-15 08:58:09	s5fs	could be used for good
2013-08-15 08:58:11	s5fs	OH SNAP
2013-08-15 08:58:21	s5fs	okay, so dig this
2013-08-15 08:58:22	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: you are a saint. I'm going to secretly install it on anyone's computer that leaves it open
2013-08-15 08:59:10	s5fs	what about a mobile app that scans barcodes and then tells you if you can eat the food (ie, it evals your nutritional concerns and then beeps or boops to let you know it's edible)
2013-08-15 08:59:20	justinabrahms	nvcexploder: things like heroku.com are the best.
2013-08-15 08:59:32	justinabrahms	http://i.imgur.com/fMzYMwz.png -- quote
2013-08-15 08:59:32	s5fs	ideally this would be built into the grocery cart, but whatever
2013-08-15 09:00:04	nvcexploder	s5fs: initial use cases I want: personal doorbell ringtones, house intercoms, and the usual (lights, temp, bathroom surveillance)
2013-08-15 09:00:25	justinabrahms	for home automation? auto turn on-off the bathroom fan would be good.
2013-08-15 09:00:27	justinabrahms	based on humidity
2013-08-15 09:00:48	s5fs	justinabrahms: could also use an air quality sensor in case it's dry but funky
2013-08-15 09:00:50	justinabrahms	also, if you want to do barcode scanner, put one by the trash so you know which groceries you don't have anymore b/c you threw away the box.
2013-08-15 09:01:06	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: hahahahahahahaaaaaaaa
2013-08-15 09:01:07	nvcexploder	ha
2013-08-15 09:01:09	nvcexploder	sniff
2013-08-15 09:01:39	s5fs	justinabrahms: yeah, i love the idea of a fridge that auto-restocks from safeway.com or something
2013-08-15 09:02:02	justinabrahms	I think there's a samsung fridge with an app store.
2013-08-15 09:02:52	s5fs	nvcexploder: those are all super cool ideas
2013-08-15 09:03:15	s5fs	I think the customizedable doorbell idea is super awesome and marketable
2013-08-15 09:03:24	s5fs	haha speling fale
2013-08-15 09:03:55	s5fs	okay i gotta host a conf call, seeya everyone!
2013-08-15 09:04:02	nvcexploder	I like it because it reminds me of Bubs. and Bubs has a really good personality.
2013-08-15 09:04:08	s5fs	i won't be attending this evening, i forgot that i have a bday thing to attend
2013-08-15 09:04:36	s5fs	nvcexploder: the next level is to have individual doorbell tones based on who's pressing it
2013-08-15 09:05:19	justinabrahms	fingerprint scanner
2013-08-15 09:05:20	nvcexploder	that's what I mean -
2013-08-15 09:05:25	nvcexploder	oh
2013-08-15 09:05:30	nvcexploder	that's not what I meant,
2013-08-15 09:05:34	nvcexploder	but holyradical
2013-08-15 09:05:48	s5fs	nvcexploder: haha, well that's a bit harder than just uploading an mp3, but it should be doable
2013-08-15 09:05:49	nvcexploder	once github becomes available I will create a repo
2013-08-15 09:06:12	s5fs	i mean, if nordstrom can track shoppers in their store, we should be able to detect who is at the front door
2013-08-15 09:06:18	justinabrahms	you could probably take the data from a fingerprint as a sample and use that to generate a tone which you can play as a ring
2013-08-15 09:06:42	s5fs	justinabrahms: i was thinking use the data leaking from cell phones (bluetooth or wifi)
2013-08-15 09:06:44	justinabrahms	alternatively, detect mac address of cellphone in their pocket
2013-08-15 09:06:45	justinabrahms	yea
2013-08-15 09:06:52	s5fs	o/
2013-08-15 09:06:55	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: that was my plan
2013-08-15 09:07:01	nvcexploder	or use bluetooth,
2013-08-15 09:07:08	nvcexploder	and once there's a mac or bluetooth ID,
2013-08-15 09:07:16	nvcexploder	then allow them to upload their own
2013-08-15 09:07:22	s5fs	okay gtg, keep brainstorming and i'll ttyl :D

2013-08-15 13:16:04	justinabrahms	My preference would have been pathfinder, but *shrug*
2013-08-15 13:16:46	nvcexploder	pathfinder is fun
2013-08-15 13:16:55	nvcexploder	have you played any 5th?
2013-08-15 13:17:13	justinabrahms	5th is a thing?
2013-08-15 13:17:19	nvcexploder	'D&D Next'
2013-08-15 13:17:31	justinabrahms	nope.
2013-08-15 13:17:35	nvcexploder	https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dndnext.aspx
2013-08-15 13:17:49	nvcexploder	we played it @ PAX last year
2013-08-15 13:18:11	nvcexploder	and you can get all the play test rules packets
2013-08-15 13:20:30	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: yeah, I still wish I could go to the trilogy
2013-08-15 13:20:32	hackygolucky_	:(
2013-08-15 13:21:15	nvcexploder	is okay
2013-08-15 13:21:48	nvcexploder	we'll have the September PDX Node be a reenactment of favorite scenes from all three.
2013-08-15 13:22:10	hackygolucky_	it's like a mini-version of Dominic's Star Wars talk. Excellent!
2013-08-15 13:22:47	JSON_voorheez	still gotta make trek in the park before its over FOREVER
2013-08-15 13:23:08	nvcexploder	yeeesssssssssss
2013-08-15 13:25:58	ericholscher	yea, I need to hit that as well
2013-08-15 13:26:07	ericholscher	this is the last weekend, right?
2013-08-15 13:27:22	hackygolucky_	ericholscher: ends on the 24th I think
2013-08-15 13:27:35	ericholscher	ah, good, so maybe it won't be packed this weekend :)
2013-08-15 13:27:58	JSON_voorheez	ericholscher: I'm sure it will, Ima try and get there early
2013-08-15 13:30:07	hackygolucky_	ericholscher: yeah, I would arrive AT LEAST 30 minutes early
2013-08-15 13:30:16	hackygolucky_	we couldn't see or hear when we got there.
2013-08-15 13:30:23	ericholscher	aye
2013-08-15 13:30:26	ericholscher	its quite popular
2013-08-15 13:59:06	dlmanning	I just wish Google knew enough about me to bring up suggestions related to the open source .NET implementation rather than disease when I type 'Mono' into the search box.
2013-08-15 14:00:36	drueck	dlmanning: I run into stuff like that a lot where things are named with super common words. Like 'Go'
2013-08-15 14:01:07	dlmanning	or 'Rust'
2013-08-15 14:01:32	drueck	dlmanning: yeah, so many. I can't decide whether I would want Google to be that smart or not.
2013-08-15 14:01:48	dlmanning	Fair point
2013-08-15 14:01:52	drueck	dlmanning: most of the time I'd like it, but when I wanted to search for actual rust, it would be annoying if it filtered those results out.
2013-08-15 14:02:24	dlmanning	There should be a 'hypochondriac safesearch' option on google
2013-08-15 14:02:33	drueck	lol
2013-08-15 14:02:47	drueck	Yep, that's the solution!

2013-08-18 13:14:25	JSON_voorhees	right
2013-08-18 13:14:55	JSON_voorhees	as of now I don't really understand how to get a 3d model animation ready...
2013-08-18 13:15:09	JSON_voorhees	but I should be able to figure it out
2013-08-18 13:15:35	JSON_voorhees	hack day would be so dope
2013-08-18 13:15:54	Wraithan	Sept 14th
2013-08-18 13:16:04	Wraithan	looks clear on my and mozilla's calendar
2013-08-18 13:16:41	Wraithan	Since it is JS based, especially browser based, I'm betting I can get mozilla sponsorship from the B2G team
2013-08-18 13:16:58	dlmanning	sponsorship?
2013-08-18 13:16:59	JSON_voorhees	man that would be awesome!
2013-08-18 13:17:03	Wraithan	anyway, gotta get food with my lady friend
2013-08-18 13:17:07	Wraithan	dlmanning: food
2013-08-18 13:17:09	dlmanning	ah

2013-08-18 13:17:26	Wraithan	dlmanning: I just decided to run a js games hack day
2013-08-18 13:17:29	JSON_voorhees	Wraithan: hit me up sometime this week so we can do some planning
2013-08-18 13:17:34	dlmanning	Wraithan: Saw that
2013-08-18 13:17:38	dlmanning	I'm down
2013-08-18 13:17:42	Wraithan	:)
2013-08-18 13:17:45	JSON_voorhees	woohooo!
2013-08-18 13:18:08	Wraithan	Should be way easier to run than the node bots day because there is no hardware involved
2013-08-18 13:18:13	JSON_voorhees	fo sho
2013-08-18 13:18:17	dlmanning	Yeah, cheaper too
2013-08-18 13:18:20	Wraithan	just hacking and doing some demos on the 85" screens in the office
2013-08-18 13:18:31	Wraithan	dlmanning: free aside from food/drink sponsor
2013-08-18 13:18:33	dlmanning	Probably need more in the way of explanation
2013-08-18 13:18:45	Wraithan	could run it over both days, Sat and Sun
2013-08-18 13:19:05	JSON_voorhees	That would probably be better
2013-08-18 13:19:16	JSON_voorhees	let people hack overnight and show stuff on sunday
2013-08-18 13:19:20	Wraithan	yea
2013-08-18 13:19:39	Wraithan	I gotta check in with the office manager to make sure it is cool also
2013-08-18 13:19:43	JSON_voorhees	sweet
2013-08-18 13:20:16	JSON_voorhees	also I'm probably going to trek in the park today if any of you would like to join
2013-08-18 13:20:32	dlmanning	What is "the park"?
2013-08-18 13:21:07	JSON_voorhees	-trekInThePark-
2013-08-18 13:21:13	JSON_voorhees	cathedral park
2013-08-18 13:21:16	JSON_voorhees	in st. Johns
2013-08-18 13:21:19	dlmanning	oic
2013-08-18 13:21:43	dlmanning	Thought you meant you were going for a trek in "the park"
2013-08-18 13:21:44	JSON_voorhees	starts at 5 but chrisdickinson and hackygolucky said u should get there super early if you wanna see anything
2013-08-18 13:21:46	JSON_voorhees	haha
2013-08-18 13:22:34	dlmanning	Like, I dunno, Forest Park?
2013-08-18 13:23:22	JSON_voorhees	I was actually planning to do an actually "trek" in forest park today, but decided on playing with 3d hotdogs instead
2013-08-18 13:23:42	JSON_voorhees	trying to get them to talk and walk around is hard
2013-08-18 13:23:52	dlmanning	I wasn't aware of non-3d hotdogs
2013-08-18 13:24:06	dlmanning	All the ones I've ever had have been 3d
2013-08-18 13:24:11	JSON_voorhees	touche
2013-08-18 13:24:51	dlmanning	Have you seen http://hot-dog-legs.tumblr.com/ ?
2013-08-18 13:24:59	JSON_voorhees	YES 
2013-08-18 13:25:07	JSON_voorhees	I rt'd it this morning its amazing
2013-08-18 13:25:16	JSON_voorhees	that was my inspiration actuall....
2013-08-18 13:25:50	JSON_voorhees	I wanna make an app where you can upload a 3d model and walk around in a space with someone your chatting with via webrtc
2013-08-18 13:26:09	JSON_voorhees	and use that head tracking library to control the hotdogs movement
2013-08-18 13:26:41	dlmanning	That's ambitious
2013-08-18 13:26:46	dlmanning	Get it?
2013-08-18 13:26:52	dlmanning	AMBitious
2013-08-18 13:27:03	JSON_voorhees	haha
2013-08-18 13:27:28	dlmanning	Man, I'm freaking hysterical
2013-08-18 13:27:45	JSON_voorhees	uploading models will be super hard, so I'm just starting with a walkin' talkin' hot doggie
2013-08-18 13:27:59	dlmanning	Sounds cool
2013-08-18 13:28:12	dlmanning	Lemme know if you want help planning the game day

2013-08-19 11:35:54	s5fs	looks like a nice build, too bad it's so spendy. i may pick one up just for rapid dev tho
2013-08-19 11:36:29	Wraithan	s5fs: but it can leech power for a device to power it, and it only takes 3.3 to switch the power on/off which means I can use basically any chip
2013-08-19 11:36:58	s5fs	yeah pretty sweet
2013-08-19 11:37:52	s5fs	i'm looking to stab an attiny or something into a metal power strip and control the outlets with a couple relays, similar idea but different form factor
2013-08-19 11:38:04	s5fs	prob just control it via bluetooth
2013-08-19 11:38:18	Wraithan	Maybe when I get more comfortable with electricity I can start building my own relays
2013-08-19 11:38:20	s5fs	i guess i could build a clapper
2013-08-19 11:38:41	s5fs	i figure the only way to get comfortable is to play in a semi-safe manner
2013-08-19 11:39:07	s5fs	anyways time for food and then more work, i'm hungry!

2013-08-19 16:05:02	chrisdickinson	sooo
2013-08-19 16:05:11	chrisdickinson	the whole "wtf is this mess" thing is a bit telling
2013-08-19 16:05:35	chrisdickinson	node's got an artisanal, hand-crafted http parser "built for speed"
2013-08-19 16:06:05	chrisdickinson	hence the big switch statement -- it's trying to pre-emptively guess the rest of the verb. if it doesn't recognize the verb, it bugs out early.
2013-08-19 16:07:11	Wraithan	I understand why they did what they did
2013-08-19 16:07:13	Wraithan	doesn't make it right
2013-08-19 16:07:15	hackygolucky_	I tend to not like to listen too much to people who aren't fans at all of something criticizing it. More objectivity on the subject will usually convince me you have a decent argument.
2013-08-19 16:10:05	chrisdickinson	it's the eternal trade off of generality vs. making something speedy

2013-08-19 16:11:45	Wraithan	I wonder how many rps they lose by checking the full string
2013-08-19 16:12:10	Wraithan	And whether they benchmarked first or just took the fastest path they could
2013-08-19 16:12:29	chrisdickinson	it's also one of the oldest parts of node
2013-08-19 16:12:59	chrisdickinson	and if you really want LINK to work, well, `require('tcp')` and build an http parser
2013-08-19 16:13:02	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-08-19 16:13:53	hackygolucky_	Yeah, seeing as that code hasn't been touched in a year...
2013-08-19 16:13:57	dlmanning	I don't get "ew, look! a switch statement. it must be bad"
2013-08-19 16:14:10	s5fs	its not a very good piece of code
2013-08-19 16:15:09	Wraithan	Looks like originally it was implemented without consideration for extensions but also using full method names
2013-08-19 16:15:10	s5fs	doesn't seem to be hurting node's uptake much
2013-08-19 16:16:10	dlmanning	That just looks like optimized code. It doesn't look bad
2013-08-19 16:16:11	Wraithan	I lied

2013-08-19 16:17:18	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: because it's generated code

2013-08-19 16:17:33	chrisdickinson	or it was, rather
2013-08-19 16:17:35	chrisdickinson	using ragel
2013-08-19 16:17:46	Wraithan	doesn't change the result
2013-08-19 16:17:52	chrisdickinson	which is?
2013-08-19 16:18:02	chrisdickinson	that not-verbs-yet can't be used as verbs?
2013-08-19 16:18:55	Wraithan	that the spec wasn't followed.
2013-08-19 16:19:07	Wraithan	I'm not saying it affects me in any serious way
2013-08-19 16:19:25	Wraithan	I wonder if it is documented anywhere that they broke the spec in this area
2013-08-19 16:20:35	Wraithan	Yeah, I'm not seeing it in the docs right off
2013-08-19 16:20:38	Wraithan	I guess that is what bothers me

2013-08-20 11:39:37	ericholscher	in that context, yes
2013-08-20 11:40:26	Wraithan	dlmanning: long story short, I think that giving away some presentation data in your css class names isn't a terrible sin, especially due to tech
2013-08-20 11:40:32	dlmanning	Huh... I always thought frontend meant what was int he browser
2013-08-20 11:41:02	dlmanning	Wraithan: Yeah, I'm not putting it up there with genocide
2013-08-20 11:41:02	justinabrahms	I don't always submit pull requests, but when I do, I'm sure to make deprecating comments about your testing infrastructure. https://github.com/urbanairship/django-finial/pull/6 ^_^
2013-08-20 11:41:22	Wraithan	dlmanning: another "good" reason for generic classes is that you can define them once and use them lots of places which results in smaller css
2013-08-20 11:41:36	justinabrahms	at many places, frontend ~= db -> UI
2013-08-20 11:41:45	s5fs	bro do you even mock?
2013-08-20 11:41:58	chrisdickinson	mocking frameworks give me a sad
2013-08-20 11:42:05	justinabrahms	I'm inserting data into the database! For a reason!
2013-08-20 11:42:08	chrisdickinson	a deep, abiding sad
2013-08-20 11:42:14	justinabrahms	backend ~= db -> sync / other server speaking / etc
2013-08-20 11:42:35	s5fs	at what point does a mock library just become a full-on simulator?
2013-08-20 11:42:42	Wraithan	Due to django's architecture mocking is pretty much required
2013-08-20 11:42:43	justinabrahms	Oooh.
2013-08-20 11:42:47	s5fs	cuz i've written some jakey shit before that straddled that line haha
2013-08-20 11:42:48	dlmanning	justinabrahms: Well I've learned something today
2013-08-20 11:42:59	justinabrahms	I need to make a business logic simulator and make it a business.
2013-08-20 11:43:10	justinabrahms	Wraithan: agreed. :(
2013-08-20 11:43:11	chrisdickinson	s5fs: you say "simulator", i think http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34JbhA154To
2013-08-20 11:43:17	s5fs	justinabrahms: sounds like a shitstorm if its modeled after most businesses i've been in ;-)
2013-08-20 11:43:51	justinabrahms	s5fs: our only savior: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/249/984/85e.jpg
2013-08-20 11:44:08	s5fs	wow
2013-08-20 11:44:09	chrisdickinson	yeah, i was reading through "two scoops of django" (which is otherwise pretty good) and it recommends "fat models", which made me gag a bit
2013-08-20 11:44:10	Wraithan	Front end is also relevant to what you are providing, django/node/flask are my front end when I am building purely API stuff
2013-08-20 11:44:27	s5fs	I was kicked out of a safeway for a year in high school for front-flipping into an end cap of toilet paper. true story.
2013-08-20 11:44:30	dlmanning	Wraithan: We need ZenWraithBot to keep track of the urls pasted here during the day and dump them into a blog
2013-08-20 11:44:33	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: we use fat models so much at mozilla :(
2013-08-20 11:44:38	justinabrahms	chrisdickinson: I'm in the "fat service objects" camp.
2013-08-20 11:44:42	Wraithan	dlmanning: easy enough
2013-08-20 11:44:46	justinabrahms	s/fat/many/
2013-08-20 11:44:49	s5fs	Wraithan: "plus-size models" you insensitive clod
2013-08-20 11:44:53	Wraithan	dlmanning: wp actually has a decent api these days
2013-08-20 11:45:26	Wraithan	s5fs: I'm fat, I can call them fat, don't you put your skinny guilt on me
2013-08-20 11:45:30	dlmanning	Wraithan: Has it improved in the last year?
2013-08-20 11:45:53	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: i'm in the "anything that disconnects storage from manipulation from display" camp
2013-08-20 11:46:01	chrisdickinson	"camp anything"
2013-08-20 11:46:02	Wraithan	Just started using it recently but I was expecting to have to do xmlrpc and instead I use json
2013-08-20 11:46:07	justinabrahms	yea. My camp calls those service objects.
2013-08-20 11:46:24	s5fs	skinny guilt, haha! i need a cheeseburger to wipe away my tears of joy

2013-08-21 10:36:38	Wraithan	I have a couple friends that started with rpis but switched to something a bit more powerful to be able to do some transcoding or emulation
2013-08-21 10:37:47	s5fs	Wraithan: the beaglebone black is awesome for $10 more
2013-08-21 10:37:54	Wraithan	yea
2013-08-21 10:37:57	s5fs	mostly I appreciate the 2gig of onboard storage
2013-08-21 10:38:21	s5fs	sdcards suck it bigtime and the performance difference across brands of identical class is substantial
2013-08-21 10:38:48	s5fs	I have some performance numbers somewhere on 16gig class 10 cards
2013-08-21 10:39:13	dlmanning	Which brand have you found to be the best?
2013-08-21 10:40:05	s5fs	dlmanning: sandisk ultra
2013-08-21 10:40:14	Wraithan	^ same in my experience
2013-08-21 10:40:25	s5fs	kingston is also good, both have solid write times
2013-08-21 10:40:39	s5fs	i haven't tracked failure but i've lost about a dozen cards this year
2013-08-21 10:40:55	Wraithan	sandisk has the read speed over kingston in my experience
2013-08-21 10:41:46	dlmanning	cool
2013-08-21 10:43:26	s5fs	we source cards from wherever so it's also possible we've been getting knock-offs
2013-08-21 10:43:59	s5fs	but i think what's more likely is that class 10 cards that don't perform are re-sold as a lower class. i've had class 4 cards outperform class 10 of the same brand as well.
2013-08-21 10:44:00	justinabrahms	jquery deferreds make approximately zero sense to me.
2013-08-21 10:44:22	justinabrahms	I keep thinking they should be implmented like java's promises.
2013-08-21 10:45:26	justinabrahms	my_promise = promise(function () { doWork(); resolve(val); });     outer_val = my_promise.getAndWait();     use(outer_val)

2013-08-21 11:27:25	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Without depending on require, I want to be able to know which symbols in a.js are defined in b.js
2013-08-21 11:28:08	dlmanning	for the purposes of extracting a subset of a.js (and b.js as needed) into an independent thing
2013-08-21 11:29:23	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: but still relying on the require interface (i.e., "var x = require('b')" in a.js with this tool would yield "x is in b.js")?
2013-08-21 11:30:37	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: That would be a bonus, but not essential for my purposes
2013-08-21 11:31:12	dlmanning	require at least makes it explicit where to look for dependencies
2013-08-21 11:32:23	dlmanning	The real difficulty is when libraries just depend on other things being in global scope
2013-08-21 11:33:26	dlmanning	When some of those individual files are 1000+ loc, it's a real pain in the ass to figure out where the dependencies are
2013-08-21 11:34:25	chrisdickinson	ah, interesting
2013-08-21 11:34:29	chrisdickinson	i believe i can help you, sir :)
2013-08-21 11:35:29	dlmanning	I thought it sounded like your kind of problem :)

2013-08-21 11:53:04	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: cssauron-falafel selector is something like: `:any(variable, assign) > id + call > id[name=require]:first-child` and that'll give you the require node
2013-08-21 11:53:30	chrisdickinson	which, if you walk up to the assign/variable from there, will give you the x = y
2013-08-21 11:53:58	chrisdickinson	i've got a tool that lets you search js codebases using those selectors, which i need to put up on github
2013-08-21 11:54:10	chrisdickinson	but i also want to add awk-style "actions" on nodes
2013-08-21 11:54:38	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Cool. I will check that out
2013-08-21 11:55:27	chrisdickinson	so, `jssel ':any(variable, assign) > id + call > id[name=require]:first-child { print $LINE ':' parents($NODE, ':any(variable, assign)') }' ./directory`
2013-08-21 11:56:11	dlmanning	At some point soon, I'm gonna try to implement the Sign class in crypto-browserify
2013-08-21 11:57:04	dlmanning	and I'm gonna yank the RSA stuff out of another open source jsrsasign to do it
2013-08-21 11:57:50	dlmanning	make that, "out of jsrsasign"

2013-08-21 13:52:21	bret	still getting the same error, but it still seems to install something
2013-08-21 13:52:27	bret	node gyp installed fine though
2013-08-21 13:52:43	hackygolucky_	bret: do you know what version of python you're running?

2013-08-27 10:56:38	nvcexploder	hey folks - can I get some feedback from y'all real quick?
2013-08-27 10:56:51	chrisdickinson	sure sure
2013-08-27 10:58:33	nvcexploder	so in the development of the talk I'm putting together for nc.eu I started off with the development of hapi at WM,
2013-08-27 10:58:35	nvcexploder	and it sucked.
2013-08-27 10:58:48	nvcexploder	I got more interested in talking about the plugin side of things -
2013-08-27 10:59:36	nvcexploder	and now am making decisions based on a plugin-specific pres (highlighting NPM and how hapi plugins are different from middle wares and why)
2013-08-27 10:59:43	nvcexploder	and going more into a 'hapi for enterprise'
2013-08-27 11:00:02	nvcexploder	which talks about other stuff we've added in for enterprise debugging
2013-08-27 11:00:26	nvcexploder	(d-trace probes, crazy logging, pictures of Miley Cyrus)
2013-08-27 11:00:37	nvcexploder	which sounds more interesting?
2013-08-27 11:00:38	nvcexploder	rather
2013-08-27 11:00:45	nvcexploder	which would y'all rather hear?
2013-08-27 11:01:35	nvcexploder	(I've only got 20 minutes, or I could cover both)
2013-08-27 11:04:12	chrisdickinson	nvcexploder: i'm interested in enterprise debugging, the why's, wherefore's and how's.
2013-08-27 11:04:27	nvcexploder	okay
2013-08-27 11:04:53	nvcexploder	so definitely include that in there?
2013-08-27 11:05:22	chrisdickinson	i'm primarily interested in, "what do you guys choose to measure? how do you surface exceptions? is there an overarching ethos?"
2013-08-27 11:05:28	chrisdickinson	yessir
2013-08-27 11:05:32	nvcexploder	word
2013-08-27 11:06:03	nvcexploder	thanks chrisdickinson!
2013-08-27 11:06:16	chrisdickinson	no prob! good luck on the talk! i'm sure it'll be awesome.
2013-08-27 11:07:15	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: which we could enjoy the castles with ye
2013-08-27 11:08:10	nvcexploder	that would be awesome!
2013-08-27 11:08:21	nvcexploder	I have a boat.
2013-08-27 11:08:29	nvcexploder	y'all could use it to cross the pond.
2013-08-27 11:08:37	nvcexploder	better leave close to now though.
2013-08-27 11:09:17	chrisdickinson	i own like 2 or 3 limes
2013-08-27 11:09:20	chrisdickinson	that's enough provisions, right?
2013-08-27 11:16:43	nvcexploder	certainly
2013-08-27 11:16:49	nvcexploder	you can catch fish AND OH CRAP.
2013-08-27 11:17:07	nvcexploder	I just remembered that we live on the Pacific Ocean, not the Atlantic
2013-08-27 11:17:12	nvcexploder	you may need to leave last week.
2013-08-27 11:17:26	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-08-27 11:17:43	hackygolucky_	I could use a good hike... across Asia and Europe.

2013-08-27 11:44:11	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky_: prolly not gunna be able to have anything ready to present for pdx node :(
2013-08-27 11:44:50	JSON_voorhees	I may have time to get something together while in virginia, but I just can't really commit, not sure how much time I'll have to work on it
2013-08-27 11:44:58	JSON_voorhees	not to mention ya boi homeless
2013-08-27 11:45:23	JSON_voorhees	I did start working on the jsgames page tho cc/ Wraithan

2013-08-27 11:45:43	JSON_voorhees	yeah
2013-08-27 11:45:58	Wraithan	I just spent 30 minutes arguing with my boss over 3 lines of code
2013-08-27 11:46:06	JSON_voorhees	dumb
2013-08-27 11:46:08	Wraithan	We are professional bike shedders at mozilla
2013-08-27 11:46:10	JSON_voorhees	haha
2013-08-27 11:46:33	JSON_voorhees	I wanna do a little sprite that you can walk around the page or like a mini game, not sure yet

2013-08-27 11:46:51	JSON_voorhees	also gunna try and have a couple simple things on gh
2013-08-27 11:46:58	JSON_voorhees	for that day, 
2013-08-27 11:46:59	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: if you have an initial pass that makes it more pallettable I'm into that as well
2013-08-27 11:47:07	 *	Wraithan adds JSON_voorhees as a colaborator
2013-08-27 11:47:15	JSON_voorhees	thanks doggie
2013-08-27 11:47:58	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: added
2013-08-27 11:47:58	JSON_voorhees	I would like to have a simple three js example, kinect-node example, and 2d platform type example,
2013-08-27 11:48:09	JSON_voorhees	but I may only be able to do like one of those just depends :)
2013-08-27 11:48:16	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: I trust that you wont bork the hell out of stuff too much
2013-08-27 11:48:22	Wraithan	:)

2013-08-27 11:49:53	<--	mghayes (~mghayes@67.131.102.78) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-08-27 11:53:18	Wraithan	to be fair the thing we were arguing about was only 3 lines of code now, but would result in 200-300 lines of code and making marketplace a special case rather than being just like every other app with inapp payments
2013-08-27 11:53:50	Wraithan	Was mostly arguing against mozilla being special at all
2013-08-27 11:58:45	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: well, that's fair. We did volunteer you without asking first.
2013-08-27 11:59:15	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky_: haha I totally would have Its hasbeen/gunnabe a real hectic month
2013-08-27 11:59:17	JSON_voorhees	bad timing.
2013-08-27 11:59:27	JSON_voorhees	should be able to next time though !
2013-08-27 11:59:35	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: we need presenters for next week?
2013-08-27 12:00:12	JSON_voorhees	maybe justinabrahms would like to do a small presentation on pageobjects?
2013-08-27 12:00:43	 *	JSON_voorhees following the trend of volunteering people...
2013-08-27 12:00:43	justinabrahms	JSON_voorhees: is just trying to sign me up for writing selenium tests for work.
2013-08-27 12:00:48	JSON_voorhees	lol
2013-08-27 12:01:06	justinabrahms	If you guys really need a presenter, I'm happy to talk about page objects.
2013-08-27 12:01:15	JSON_voorhees	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2013-08-27 12:01:17	justinabrahms	when is the meeting?
2013-08-27 12:01:26	justinabrahms	don't say thursday.
2013-08-27 12:01:33	hackygolucky_	not this thursday
2013-08-27 12:01:44	hackygolucky_	Thursday the 5th
2013-08-27 12:01:55	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: but yes, we still need a speaker or two
2013-08-27 12:02:13	hackygolucky_	otherwise I'll be giving some random talk on a module of the week or something
2013-08-27 12:02:13	JSON_voorhees	wasnt faddah gunna show a video or something?
2013-08-27 12:02:16	hackygolucky_	he is
2013-08-27 12:02:18	hackygolucky_	that's one.
2013-08-27 12:02:21	justinabrahms	I could talk about that if you want.
2013-08-27 12:02:27	hackygolucky_	we do two long-form and one lightning, generally
2013-08-27 12:02:33	justinabrahms	Should be enough time to get together something.
2013-08-27 12:02:36	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: hmmmmmm
2013-08-27 12:02:47	Wraithan	justinabrahms: you wanna take the long form and I'll take the lightning?
2013-08-27 12:03:05	justinabrahms	Wraithan: sure thing.
2013-08-27 12:03:10	Wraithan	Awesome
2013-08-27 12:03:21	Wraithan	Now to figure out what I want to give a lightning talk on
2013-08-27 12:04:21	Wraithan	maybe a short thing on using http.createServer() for simple projects rather than finding a framework
2013-08-27 12:06:48	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: that sounds nice.
2013-08-27 12:06:55	hackygolucky_	I hate people having to jump into a framework to do that.
2013-08-27 12:07:02	hackygolucky_	and it is really pretty simple
2013-08-27 12:07:27	Wraithan	I have a couple examples of simple api endpoints that just use that rather than any framework
2013-08-27 12:07:32	Wraithan	I'll build a presentation
2013-08-27 12:08:23	hackygolucky_	weee!
2013-08-27 12:08:43	 *	hackygolucky_ goes to update calagator

2013-08-27 12:10:05	hackygolucky_	nice.
2013-08-27 12:10:06	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: so I'll have to appologize now for any issues
2013-08-27 12:10:18	hackygolucky_	ah, whatever. Space is always generous and appreciated.
2013-08-27 12:10:36	Wraithan	I'll definitely set it up to record the meetup then try to edit it all so we can post it up somewhere
2013-08-27 12:10:53	Wraithan	I can also live stream to air.mozilla.org, not sure how to set it up to stream to other places
2013-08-27 12:11:12	hackygolucky_	which reminds me for the thousandth time we need to work on the site. :-/
2013-08-27 12:11:23	hackygolucky_	so we have some place to show that video.
2013-08-27 12:11:29	Wraithan	yeah :/
2013-08-27 12:11:52	Wraithan	I wonder if you can embed air.m.o videos on other sites
2013-08-27 12:11:58	Wraithan	I'll have to look into it

2013-08-28 10:18:27	chrisdickinson	AWinterman: shore
2013-08-28 10:18:48	AWinterman	so to summarize we've got this: https://gist.github.com/AWinterman/15903e1edfb445789135
2013-08-28 10:19:13	AWinterman	which is somehwo related to this: https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/45a13d96747deb52cd8fedcec7a2a32b2abf8fee
2013-08-28 10:20:18	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: shouldn't there be a new instance of `this` for each object state?
2013-08-28 10:21:00	AWinterman	my understanding of the problem is that somehow I've set an event emitter to listen to itself for data events
2013-08-28 10:21:39	chrisdickinson	you haven't, it's because the `= new EventEmitter` paradigm is really, really flawed
2013-08-28 10:22:25	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: oh, for inheritance?
2013-08-28 10:22:56	chrisdickinson	yes
2013-08-28 10:23:46	Wraithan	Oh, mghayes is in here
2013-08-28 10:23:49	Wraithan	I never see him speak
2013-08-28 10:24:07	mghayes	hey Wraithan
2013-08-28 10:24:37	chrisdickinson	basically just got a tongue-lashing from isaacs about using `= new Parent` style inheritance :)
2013-08-28 10:24:57	AWinterman	heh
2013-08-28 10:25:12	mghayes	instead of Object.create(parent.prototype)
2013-08-28 10:25:13	mghayes	?
2013-08-28 10:25:17	chrisdickinson	yes
2013-08-28 10:25:43	chrisdickinson	well, `utils.inherits`, but `Object.create` in a pinch
2013-08-28 10:26:21	mghayes	I see the problem now...
2013-08-28 10:29:08	chrisdickinson	AWinterman: pushed a fix, 0.0.2

2013-08-28 11:52:06	justinabrahms	after 5 hours of playing with the node webdriver bindings.. I'm switching back to python. :-/   Turns out webdriver testing isn't a good fit for async apis.
2013-08-28 11:54:18	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: thank you for trying
2013-08-28 11:54:44	justinabrahms	no worries.
2013-08-28 11:54:55	justinabrahms	Mostly said it in here, not to troll, but as a PSA for folks who might try it.
2013-08-28 11:55:10	justinabrahms	You should, instead, NOT use it and embrace the page object pattern instead.
2013-08-28 11:56:03	justinabrahms	hackygolucky: ^^ Unless you want to hear me say that node + wd != good, then I'm probably not a good fit for the talk JSON_voorhees coerced me into.
2013-08-28 11:56:32	hackygolucky_	justinabrahms: I think sharing your failings regarding it might give you and us some insight
2013-08-28 11:56:39	hackygolucky_	and people at the meetup might be able to share alternatives
2013-08-28 11:56:46	justinabrahms	mmkay.
2013-08-28 11:57:05	justinabrahms	End result is that we're 90+% likely going to move over to python for functional tests.

2013-09-04 13:21:02	dlmanning	faddah: What's up?
2013-09-04 13:24:09	faddah	hi dlmanning - i'm going through the express tutorial for using it to cease apps with node, here =>  http://expressjs.com/guide.html . in there, for the functions for the “hello world” app, there are two 'app.get(…)' functions shown. do i put _both_ in my app.js file, or just choose one? does node & js do “overloading” of functions like C++ or Java where the compiler/runtime figure which function is meant and choose it? or do 
2013-09-04 13:24:10	faddah	just choose one?
2013-09-04 13:26:14	dlmanning	faddah: Each app.get(...) corresponds to a route
2013-09-04 13:26:48	dlmanning	If I'm looking at the same part of the guide that you are, those are two different examples
2013-09-04 13:27:04	faddah	dlmanning - so just choose one?
2013-09-04 13:27:15	dlmanning	they're both for app.get('hello.txt', ...), right?
2013-09-04 13:27:30	faddah	dlmanning - i believe so, yes (sorry, just learning here).
2013-09-04 13:27:59	dlmanning	Okay, so the point it's making there is that those two examples do the same thing
2013-09-04 13:28:30	faddah	dlmanning - o.k…. sorry to be pedantic, but - just choose one for my code?
2013-09-04 13:28:40	dlmanning	faddah: yes
2013-09-04 13:28:52	faddah	dlmanning, thank you. one more thing if you have time?
2013-09-04 13:28:55	dlmanning	sure
2013-09-04 13:31:20	faddah	dlmanning: thank you. so i did the npm install -g express in the directory i'm creating this test app. but then when i try and do what it says on that guide page, 'express --help' or 'express --sessions --css stylus --ejs myapp,' it says it 'express: command not found.'  i'm on mac os x 10.8.4, all the updates installed, using the terminal.
2013-09-04 13:32:08	dlmanning	faddah: What method did you use to install node?
2013-09-04 13:33:12	faddah	oh crap. that was months ago. barely remember. downloaded off the node.js web page??
2013-09-04 13:33:21	dlmanning	Okay
2013-09-04 13:33:30	faddah	i have nom, should i reinstall node globally?
2013-09-04 13:33:38	faddah	npm, pardon
2013-09-04 13:33:52	dlmanning	Don't think so, just trying to figure out where npm put the express executable
2013-09-04 13:34:31	dlmanning	probably what's happening is that npm installed the express executable in a place that's not in your shell path
2013-09-04 13:34:51	faddah	dlmanning: yeah, i'd love to know that too.  :P  :/  looked in /usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/express , but didn't see an exectable/app .
2013-09-04 13:35:13	faddah	dlmanning:  exectable => executable, sorry.
2013-09-04 13:35:31	dlmanning	look in /usr/local/share/npm/bin/
2013-09-04 13:35:57	faddah	dlmanning - oh great. $PATH on mac os x and knowing what profile file to stick it in is a pain.
2013-09-04 13:36:14	faddah	looking, hang on, please, dlmanning. i appreciate the help.
2013-09-04 13:36:40	chrisdickinson	mine are all in `/usr/local/bin`, with installed modules in `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/`
2013-09-04 13:36:59	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Is that where the node installer sets them up by default?
2013-09-04 13:37:11	chrisdickinson	afaik, yes. i'm using the pkg installer
2013-09-04 13:37:46	dlmanning	k, I used brew, so mine may be different
2013-09-04 13:38:31	faddah	actually, an alias/sym-link is in /usr/local/share/npm/bin , mine is apparently in /usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/express/bin
2013-09-04 13:39:02	dlmanning	right, that's the same as mine
2013-09-04 13:39:48	dlmanning	Does '/usr/local/share/npm/bin/express -h' get you a help message?
2013-09-04 13:44:52	faddah	yes. so use that?
2013-09-04 13:45:48	dlmanning	yeah, add /usr/local/share/npm/bin/ to your path
2013-09-04 13:47:56	faddah	o.k.  thank you very much dlmanning & chrisdickinson
2013-09-04 13:48:06	faddah	further along so i know what to do now. thank you.

2013-09-04 14:16:25	faddah	one last thing, in firing up the experss/node 'hello world' test app, when i go to http://localhost:3000/hello.txt, it says:  'Cannot GET /hello.txt'   (???)
2013-09-04 14:16:45	faddah	i know - this is like my fifth 'last thing.' sorry.  :/
2013-09-04 14:16:52	dlmanning	You added the route in the example?
2013-09-04 14:16:54	faddah	:`(
2013-09-04 14:17:16	faddah	dlmanning - route?
2013-09-04 14:17:21	faddah	wait...
2013-09-04 14:17:58	dlmanning	app.get('/hello.txt', function () { res.send ('Hello World'); });
2013-09-04 14:18:00	dlmanning	^ that
2013-09-04 14:18:56	faddah	yup, that's in there. tried both that, then commenting it out and the other version they list, recompile. both give me 'Cannot GET /hello.txt.'
2013-09-04 14:19:45	dlmanning	Could you paste your app.js into a gist?
2013-09-04 14:20:22	faddah	the listening on the server sez:  GET /hello.txt 404 28ms   GET /hello.txt 404 6ms   GET //hello.txt 404 4ms   GET /hello.txt 404 36m?s    … so it's 404 every time.
2013-09-04 14:20:30	faddah	dlmanning - sure, doing that now.
2013-09-04 14:25:05	faddah	dlmanning - which app.js btw - the one i made from the code in the guide in my 'hello-world' directory, or the one that gets created when i do 'express --sessions --css stylus --ejs myapp' one director down in the 'myapp' directory?
2013-09-04 14:26:20	dlmanning	faddah: I think that may be your problem :)
2013-09-04 14:26:41	dlmanning	Which one are you running?
2013-09-04 14:27:19	dlmanning	If you didn't add the route handler to the file your running, the resulting server's not going to know about the route
2013-09-04 14:28:12	dlmanning	I believe you're running the app.js that was generated by express, add the app.get('/hello.txt', ...) line to that file just above the default route
2013-09-04 14:28:50	faddah	dlmanning - ?? i was following what the instructions said in http://expressjs.com/guide.html . says to type in 'express --sessions --css stylus --ejs myapp' then after that completes, 'cd myapp && npm install' then 'node app'
2013-09-04 14:29:41	dlmanning	faddah: It's not a step-by-step guide
2013-09-04 14:29:50	dlmanning	It's a series of examples
2013-09-04 14:36:44	faddah	ech. crap. i was reading it as a guide, as its title is: “guide.”  :/
2013-09-04 14:37:56	faddah	dlmanning: so how would i compile & run in express this app? —> (the gist you wanted) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6443088
2013-09-04 14:40:03	dlmanning	faddah : Add app.get('/hello.txt', function (req, res) { res.send('Hello World'); }); to the generated app.js
2013-09-04 14:40:25	dlmanning	add it just above the like that begins app.get('/', ...)
2013-09-04 14:40:42	faddah	dlmanning:  can't do it with the one i made?
2013-09-04 14:40:47	dlmanning	You can
2013-09-04 14:41:28	dlmanning	You can just execute 'node app.js' in that directory
2013-09-04 14:42:55	faddah	yay!
2013-09-04 14:42:58	faddah	that did it.
2013-09-04 14:43:03	faddah	thank you again, dlmanning
2013-09-04 14:43:06	dlmanning	:)
2013-09-04 14:43:44	faddah	won't bother folk here any more, other stuff to do. but thank you for the help & education. i was trying to follow the guide literally. my bad.
2013-09-04 14:45:42	dlmanning	faddah: happy noding
2013-09-04 14:46:27	faddah	dlmanning - thanx!

2013-09-05 13:38:29	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I can let some people store their bikes in the back
2013-09-05 13:38:56	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: so do we need to ring to get in at Mozilla?
2013-09-05 13:39:16	hackygolucky_	I will prob get there a tad early for prosperity
2013-09-05 13:39:17	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: nah, they should know at the desk downstairs and will let you up
2013-09-05 13:40:04	Wraithan	6pm the elevators require a badge to get up to our floor, but the front desk people will know about our meetup and let people up while there are there (until 7 or 7:30 iirc
2013-09-05 13:41:48	Wraithan	Looks like elevator will not need badge until 7:30, so you don't even need to talk to them

2013-09-05 13:44:50	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: bike parking is in the employee only area, so just bring it up. Bring it up stairs, leave it in the hall to the right when facing our door, then I'll come out and let you into our employee area's back entrance which is the bike entrance

2013-09-09 10:05:47	hackygolucky_	nvcexploder: there was a company that visited PDXnode the other night to introduce their module analytics project--'if you have any members here who have published a module on npm, we should talk'
2013-09-09 10:06:08	nvcexploder	awesome!!! ^Lift?
2013-09-09 10:06:10	hackygolucky_	why yes, think there's one or two people who have done that here in PDX :D
2013-09-09 10:06:10	NotMyself	nvcexploder: yeah I feel conflicted about it as well
2013-09-09 10:06:14	nvcexploder	yeah

2013-09-09 10:06:42	nvcexploder	hmmm… Lift is doing the same thing, or perhaps something similar
2013-09-09 10:06:48	hackygolucky_	yup yup.
2013-09-09 10:07:01	hackygolucky_	I chuckled and looked towards chrisdickinson when they announced that.
2013-09-09 10:07:18	hackygolucky_	and I think dlmanning is producing quite a few now himself.
2013-09-09 10:07:23	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: yeah, they seeked me out because I appeared to know things about node
2013-09-09 10:07:37	Wraithan	jokes on them!
2013-09-09 10:08:16	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: you're full of lies. And knowledge.
2013-09-09 10:08:59	Wraithan	If you flip my talk around: folks, I can't figure out your fancy libraries, so I just use the standard lib
2013-09-09 10:09:17	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-09-09 10:10:23	nvcexploder	Wraithan: there's a cluster of Mozilla duders here

2013-09-09 10:15:15	chrisdickinson	it sound amazing.
2013-09-09 10:15:25	Wraithan	so they made a tech conference into more of a sausage fest

2013-09-09 14:01:57	dlmanning	Thanks!
2013-09-09 14:03:28	dlmanning	If anyone has any syllabus suggestions I will gladly accept them
2013-09-09 14:05:22	dlmanning	I think I convinced Cris that introducing javascript through node was a good idea
2013-09-09 14:05:48	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: DUDE.

2013-09-09 14:07:08	dlmanning	Hah, let's hope so.
2013-09-09 14:07:22	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: let me know if there's anything I or we can do to help.
2013-09-09 14:07:42	dlmanning	Thanks
2013-09-09 14:08:17	hackygolucky_	could also maybe test drive your beginner stuff to let you know if there's anything I'd struggle with. Certainly not that far out of the gate...
2013-09-09 14:09:45	dlmanning	What would be really awesome is anyone's perspective on what topic are important for people to learn assuming they want to get hired as junior developers
2013-09-09 14:10:10	dlmanning	Seeing as how that's what these folks will be paying for
2013-09-09 14:12:25	hackygolucky_	managing your dev setup
2013-09-09 14:12:40	hackygolucky_	guis, text editors, git
2013-09-09 14:14:32	dlmanning	Yeah, definitely git
2013-09-09 14:25:48	Wraithan	I agree that introducing via node isn't a bad idea, but junior with js skills will be shunted toward front end development
2013-09-09 14:26:43	Wraithan	where if all they know is node they will probably have a bad time
2013-09-09 14:34:16	dlmanning	Wraithan: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to be teaching them node (at least not in exclusion to frontend stuff)
2013-09-09 14:34:52	dlmanning	But I was thinking of using node as a vanilla javascript environment for learning basic programming principles, rather than routing them through jQuery first
2013-09-09 14:36:03	dlmanning	So I'd present jQuery a little later in the context of: "and here's this convenient library for DOM manipulation"
2013-09-09 14:36:15	justinabrahms	dlmanning: how to write a test. How to debug a problem. What jquery is. How web frameworks work.
2013-09-09 14:36:50	justinabrahms	I've just gone through a round of hiring (from jr to sr) and that's what I was looking for from a Junior dev.
2013-09-09 14:37:37	justinabrahms	Actually the last one I wasn't very strong on, just something I've heard pyladies having trouble with.
2013-09-09 14:38:33	dlmanning	justinabrahms: thanks. yeah... it's gonna be interesting figuring out how to introduce testing
2013-09-09 14:40:10	justinabrahms	"You will be graded based on the number of bugs I find. I know secrets about how to write less buggy code. I will teach them to you."
2013-09-09 14:41:01	dlmanning	wow. secrets about how to write less buggy code
2013-09-09 14:44:17	dlmanning	I could use those

2013-09-09 17:23:30	drueck	Chuck Lauer Vose, who I think started the PCS, is always at the Ruby meetups and he talks about the target audience for PCS as people who have never programmed, but whose programmer friends think they would be great at it.
2013-09-09 17:23:48	drueck	So yeah, newbies. : )
2013-09-09 17:24:22	drueck	I'm sure some of the students would have some experience, though. It would be weird to commit to a program like that haven't never coded at all before.
2013-09-09 17:26:54	dlmanning	yeah, I'm hoping for a least an understanding that javascript and html are different things

2013-09-12 11:05:39	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: btw, here's our version of that js-assesment stuff, which is far less complete (probably): https://gist.github.com/chrisdickinson/821359fb8d95570ab22a
2013-09-12 11:06:29	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Thanks! I can tell who wrote that from the subject headers
2013-09-12 11:06:37	chrisdickinson	:D
2013-09-12 11:07:26	dlmanning	github needs a way to bookmark gists
2013-09-12 11:08:24	dlmanning	So you guys probably knew this, but I didn't. PCS works on a system where perspective employers pay $3500 to hire graduating students
2013-09-12 11:08:25	chrisdickinson	i think that's the purpose of starring them
2013-09-12 11:08:43	dlmanning	This money refunds the cost of the students' tuition
2013-09-12 11:08:58	dlmanning	So if you get a job, your training was free
2013-09-12 11:10:05	dlmanning	Also, good point about starring
2013-09-12 11:12:57	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: "Everyone at Boucoup has 25% open source time to work on non commercial projects on a weekly or monthly basis." thought this was interesting
2013-09-12 11:13:02	hackygolucky_	justinabrahms pointed it out.
2013-09-12 11:13:24	chrisdickinson	to be fair, they also have 10% time to spend having rwaldron put the fear of god into them
2013-09-12 11:13:37	dlmanning	Is that real 25% time or 125% time?
2013-09-12 11:14:43	hackygolucky_	hahaha
2013-09-12 11:14:45	hackygolucky_	yeah
2013-09-12 11:18:52	justinabrahms	I also like how they layout their interview process. http://workat.bocoup.com/
2013-09-12 11:21:48	s5fs	the bocoup crew is awesome
2013-09-12 11:22:47	s5fs	ps, i have a stack of their stickers if anyone wants 'em
2013-09-12 11:23:21	hackygolucky_	s5fs: could always use more of those stickers :)
2013-09-12 11:23:46	s5fs	i'll have 'em with me at the next meetup i attend, and a bunch of j5 stickers
2013-09-12 11:25:19	Wraithan	I know some bocoup folks, they are nice
2013-09-12 11:26:23	s5fs	Wraithan: i figured you would
2013-09-12 11:26:40	Wraithan	Well, they had some of their people working on FxOS
2013-09-12 11:26:46	Wraithan	(we contracted them)
2013-09-12 11:26:56	JSON_voorhees	that guy cory did the messages app right?
2013-09-12 11:26:57	s5fs	yup, corey was here for a few weeks
2013-09-12 11:27:06	Wraithan	yup
2013-09-12 11:27:16	s5fs	corey got me on the jquery team, that's my connection
2013-09-12 11:27:19	Wraithan	I don't know if he did the whole messages app
2013-09-12 11:27:28	Wraithan	I know he was here working on MMS though
2013-09-12 11:27:44	s5fs	heh, i guess we could dig thru the repo and see exactly what he did
2013-09-12 11:30:42	dlmanning	Is it weird to wish for/expect documentation to be structured the same way as the objective structure of the API they describe?
2013-09-12 11:31:35	dlmanning	I hate topical API documentation that slices across the object structure

2013-09-12 14:39:30	s5fs	i've been instructed not to expect the zte phones to be that great (ie not for daily use)
2013-09-12 14:40:43	Wraithan	the version that comes on them is not great (1.0.1) but an update that is coming out OTA in the next week or two will allow you to unlock the bootloader and build or download a 1.1 image for it
2013-09-12 14:41:26	Wraithan	Also it is pretty cheap, so worst case, you keep it as a dev phone to use on wifi and try things
2013-09-12 14:41:33	s5fs	yeah for $80 i plan on getting one
2013-09-12 15:07:20	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I like this idea of test based assessment. Do you think it'd be too much for absolute beginners?

2013-09-12 17:25:42	jden	ah, so I can't do something like `beefy --browserify "node build.js" foo.js`?
2013-09-12 17:26:28	chrisdickinson	not at present. the filename-to-be-browserified gets dumped in as the first argument always

2013-09-12 20:05:02	Wraithan	Nah, next week
2013-09-12 20:05:05	Wraithan	tonight is sepoconi
2013-09-12 20:12:09	dlmanning	Ah
2013-09-12 20:13:01	Wraithan	dlmanning: oh, so I was thinking, of the skills that you might be touching on in your curriculum, one that I have that is way stronger than my JS skill is my git skill
2013-09-12 20:13:20	Wraithan	I'd be down to mentor a night you are teaching folks about that
2013-09-12 20:13:52	dlmanning	Wraithan: That would be great
2013-09-12 20:13:58	Wraithan	If a mentor or teacher recommend git commit -am, I will slap them
2013-09-12 20:14:00	Wraithan	just so you know
2013-09-12 20:14:11	Wraithan	git commit -a is evil
2013-09-12 20:14:16	dlmanning	Nah, I'll just teach them git add .
2013-09-12 20:14:22	Wraithan	:( :( :(
2013-09-12 20:14:26	Wraithan	I've seen so much bad

2013-09-12 20:14:56	dlmanning	Seriously though, yeah. That would be great. I'm planning on having them submit weekly projects on git
2013-09-12 20:15:13	Wraithan	Awesome
2013-09-12 20:15:19	Wraithan	regular git commits, I like it
2013-09-12 20:16:13	dlmanning	I'm not sure when we'll get to anything advancedish, like merging
2013-09-12 20:16:56	dlmanning	They'll mostly be forking and submitting PR's
2013-09-12 20:17:21	Wraithan	Cool, I'm certain someone will mess something up doing that, and I'll happily help folks
2013-09-12 20:17:33	dlmanning	That'd be awesome
2013-09-12 20:17:54	dlmanning	Also, I'll likely miss at least one session when my kids is born, so if anyone wants to volunteer to sub
2013-09-12 20:17:55	Wraithan	helping noobies is way nicer than helping folks that know 4 other vcs and complain the whole time

2013-09-12 20:20:39	Wraithan	took me 3 months and 2 git filter-branch before I got everyone at my last company using it
2013-09-12 20:20:39	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: we could tag team it :)
2013-09-12 20:20:39	hackygolucky_	"HI! We're PDXnode, hopefully we don't overwhelm you with our zealotry for javascript!"
2013-09-12 20:20:39	dlmanning	Chant everything in unison

2013-09-12 20:21:55	hackygolucky_	:D

2013-09-12 20:22:17	hackygolucky_	and monotone.
2013-09-12 20:22:29	hackygolucky_	I'll have to practice that without breaking.
2013-09-12 20:22:29	Wraithan	5 people all saying the same thing, monotone, speaking as if they are one person
2013-09-12 20:22:45	hackygolucky_	I'll start convulsing from trying not to laugh.

2013-09-12 20:22:58	dlmanning	Aw, thanks. I'm a little nervous about the fact that these people are paying a lot of money with the hope of getting jobs
2013-09-12 20:23:15	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: would make it better
2013-09-12 20:23:26	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: you start convulsing then fall to the ground
2013-09-12 20:23:27	hackygolucky_	heh, maybe.
2013-09-12 20:23:30	hackygolucky_	oh no!
2013-09-12 20:23:38	hackygolucky_	we'd have to watch me

2013-09-12 20:23:45	hackygolucky_	I have a history of seizures!

2013-09-12 20:24:35	hackygolucky_	I kid. Sort of. My seizures weren't convulsive.
2013-09-12 20:25:05	dlmanning	Amy had a seizure one time out of nowhere. It was scary
2013-09-12 20:25:12	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: oh really, sorry to make the joke

2013-09-12 20:25:36	hackygolucky_	it was a period of time long long ago.

2013-09-12 20:25:47	hackygolucky_	and even if it were still happening, I'd make jokes.
2013-09-12 20:25:56	Wraithan	you don't have to
2013-09-12 20:26:03	dlmanning	Wraithan: I may try to come for the morning. Our baby shower is in the afternoon

2013-09-12 20:26:26	Wraithan	it can just be me and JSON_voorhees hanging out, eating stuff from hotlips
2013-09-12 20:26:35	hackygolucky_	It's like people are trying to extend summer or something.
2013-09-12 20:26:42	Wraithan	I have budget to feed like 40 people

2013-09-12 20:28:52	chrisdickinson	D`: cod
2013-09-12 20:28:56	hackygolucky_	justinabrahms runs into that problem.

2013-09-12 20:29:11	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Just remember to beat the hell out of one of the audience in the first couple of minutes
2013-09-12 20:29:17	dlmanning	Then they'll respect you
2013-09-12 20:29:18	Wraithan	women have it easy! they can eat like 400-500 calories less!
2013-09-12 20:29:23	Wraithan	no problem
2013-09-12 20:29:51	Wraithan	I'm at like 1000 for the day
2013-09-12 20:30:01	Wraithan	I need to jack in like 900 more
2013-09-12 20:30:04	Wraithan	at least
2013-09-12 20:30:07	chrisdickinson	i ate a bowl and a half of pistachios
2013-09-12 20:30:12	chrisdickinson	and a larabar
2013-09-12 20:30:29	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: yeah, cashews are how I get my calories up at the end of the day
2013-09-12 20:30:30	 *	chrisdickinson forages
2013-09-12 20:30:42	Wraithan	because they don't upset my stomach if I eat them before bed
2013-09-12 20:31:22	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: you going to come to the gamesjs thing and make slides there?
2013-09-12 20:31:23	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: for a minute today after I saw your bowl of pistachio shells I thought you had switched to paleo
2013-09-12 20:31:23	Wraithan	:D
2013-09-12 20:31:31	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: hah
2013-09-12 20:31:32	hackygolucky_	"where's the pretzels?!?"
2013-09-12 20:31:49	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky_: the thrill is gone
2013-09-12 20:31:52	chrisdickinson	pretzel-wise
2013-09-12 20:31:58	hackygolucky_	also, larabars aren't far off from straight cashews.
2013-09-12 20:32:15	Wraithan	too far for me right now
2013-09-12 20:32:18	Wraithan	dem carbs
2013-09-12 20:32:22	hackygolucky_	they are usually only around 3 ingredients: cashews + dried fruit (and maybe + more nuts)
2013-09-12 20:32:25	Wraithan	dried fruit has tons of them
2013-09-12 20:32:36	hackygolucky_	no kidding
2013-09-12 20:32:38	Wraithan	all of that delicious sugar
2013-09-12 20:32:42	hackygolucky_	I have to stay away from dried fruit
2013-09-12 20:32:52	hackygolucky_	I could eat a giant container of raisins and be happy
2013-09-12 20:33:00	hackygolucky_	soooo much sugar.
2013-09-12 20:33:02	Wraithan	until the next day.
2013-09-12 20:33:13	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-09-12 20:33:15	hackygolucky_	wanh wanh
2013-09-12 20:33:21	hackygolucky_	baby baby prunes
2013-09-12 20:33:37	Wraithan	dates and I have a relationship like that
2013-09-12 20:33:45	Wraithan	I will eat them until they make me regret it
2013-09-12 20:33:50	Wraithan	those fuckers
2013-09-12 20:34:10	hackygolucky_	I love how we went from PDXnode teaching in the royal 'We' in unison to dried fruit and digestion.
2013-09-12 20:34:23	hackygolucky_	gawd dates are delicious
2013-09-12 20:34:28	hackygolucky_	but they look like cockroaches.
2013-09-12 20:34:36	hackygolucky_	friggin' candy they are.
2013-09-12 20:34:49	dlmanning	bacon wrapped dates
2013-09-12 20:34:59	dlmanning	That's the way to eat dates
2013-09-12 20:35:09	hackygolucky_	YES.
2013-09-12 20:35:20	hackygolucky_	best thing that could have possibly come out of paleo
2013-09-12 20:35:21	Wraithan	I am going to make some bacon wrapped chicken later tonight to take to work tomorrow
2013-09-12 20:35:32	hackygolucky_	how do you not eat that immediately?
2013-09-12 20:35:41	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: very carefully
2013-09-12 20:35:44	dlmanning	http://baconmethod.com/
2013-09-12 20:35:49	Wraithan	notice how I am talking about eating now
2013-09-12 20:35:59	Wraithan	I'm going to stuff my face until I don't want to eat, then make it and some stir fry
2013-09-12 20:36:39	Wraithan	peppers are delicious and low enough glycemic index that it wont muck with this whole ketogenic thing I have going for me
2013-09-12 20:37:09	Wraithan	I have peanut oil now so I can fry it up proper
2013-09-12 20:38:13	Wraithan	I have some cheap flank steak I got from new seasons (unfortunately the best butcher near me)
2013-09-12 20:38:45	Wraithan	why are there 0 butchers within 2-3 miles :(
2013-09-12 20:52:54	hackygolucky_	is Chop just a restaurant?
2013-09-12 20:52:59	hackygolucky_	That place on N. williams?
2013-09-12 20:53:23	hackygolucky_	we bike by it on the way home :) http://chopbutchery.com/
2013-09-12 20:53:41	Wraithan	still ~3 miles from my house
2013-09-12 20:53:49	Wraithan	though pretty convenient on my way home
2013-09-12 20:54:22	Wraithan	oh, about 2mi
2013-09-12 20:57:19	Wraithan	maybe I'll go there
2013-09-12 21:05:18	hackygolucky_	I would check to see if they're still open
2013-09-12 21:05:35	hackygolucky_	I'm getting mixed signals from the internet that it may have shuttered that location
2013-09-12 21:05:46	hackygolucky_	but then there are comments reviewing it very recently.
2013-09-12 21:09:20	Wraithan	http://chopbutchery.com/beans/
2013-09-12 21:09:28	Wraithan	bottom of that page shows the downtown location
2013-09-12 21:10:14	Wraithan	I'll probably just do the journey to gartners
2013-09-12 21:10:16	Wraithan	it is always worth it

2013-09-12 23:29:17	dietrich	haha was just reading the node code in Google's Coder sample app, and saw a mention in this channel
2013-09-12 23:29:26	dietrich	but it was not as cosmic as i thought
2013-09-12 23:31:19	Wraithan	haha
2013-09-12 23:31:25	Wraithan	just me, sorry
2013-09-12 23:31:43	Wraithan	dietrich: just trying to find a butcher anywhere near where I am
2013-09-12 23:31:50	Wraithan	they would have been the closest at ~2mi
2013-09-12 23:32:44	dietrich	Wraithan: well new seasons is only 1 block further now ;)
2013-09-12 23:32:52	dietrich	interstate new seasons might've been closer
2013-09-12 23:32:58	Wraithan	dietrich: it is closer for me
2013-09-12 23:33:18	Wraithan	1.4 miles of flat
2013-09-12 23:33:18	dietrich	Wraithan: there's the old skool butcher out on lombard
2013-09-12 23:33:27	dietrich	always wanted to stop in there
2013-09-12 23:33:30	Wraithan	yeah, I grew up ~10 blocks from there
2013-09-12 23:33:34	Wraithan	been there tons and tons of times
2013-09-12 23:33:36	dietrich	haha nice
2013-09-12 23:33:36	Wraithan	great folks
2013-09-12 23:33:44	dietrich	the signs etc all look circa 1950s
2013-09-12 23:33:45	Wraithan	It is actually on killingsworth
2013-09-12 23:33:54	Wraithan	after lombard merges into killingsworth
2013-09-12 23:33:55	dietrich	hm, nope i'm thinking of lombard for sure
2013-09-12 23:34:09	Wraithan	http://www.gartnersmeats.com/ ?
2013-09-12 23:34:14	dietrich	nope

2013-09-14 11:08:15	Wraithan	haha
2013-09-14 11:08:33	hackygolucky_	sorry... Next time I'll put some energy into helping you.
2013-09-14 11:08:47	hackygolucky_	I've been juggling a lot lately.
2013-09-14 11:09:08	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: no, not your fault at all
2013-09-14 11:09:36	Wraithan	It didn't occur to me until today

2013-09-14 11:28:00	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: +1 going with assert
2013-09-14 11:28:19	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: just pushed a new version, see if it fixes things?
2013-09-14 11:28:34	chrisdickinson	(basically if there's no `document.body` it adds a listener for DOMContentLoaded and tries again, HARDER
2013-09-14 11:28:37	chrisdickinson	)
2013-09-14 11:29:46	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Have a recommendation for a runner?
2013-09-14 11:29:50	chrisdickinson	re: three.js, you can add a `--noparse=/path/to/three.js` and it should speed up builds significantly
2013-09-14 11:29:52	chrisdickinson	tape
2013-09-14 11:30:02	chrisdickinson	or just run them as programs
2013-09-14 11:30:10	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: issue closed, thanks!
2013-09-14 11:30:18	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: woo!
2013-09-14 11:30:56	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: actually, mocha's tdd runner isn't bad
2013-09-14 11:31:15	chrisdickinson	but i'm really at a point with js tests that i don't want to rely on an external runner for things to "work right"
2013-09-14 11:31:29	chrisdickinson	i'd model things off of how node.js itself runs js tests, or how tape works
2013-09-14 11:31:48	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Yeah. issacs was griping about mocha the other day, but I'm wondering if he really meant chai
2013-09-14 11:31:52	chrisdickinson	since there's no really "one size fits all" js test runner imo
2013-09-14 11:32:16	chrisdickinson	http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#tdd-interface
2013-09-14 11:32:31	chrisdickinson	that's how drive.js was structured
2013-09-14 11:32:53	chrisdickinson	but after using drive.js (and thus this interface) for a long time, i have to say, tape would be a lot better
2013-09-14 11:32:59	chrisdickinson	(the gripe is that it's noisy)
2013-09-14 11:33:19	chrisdickinson	(but you can just `node test/index.js | grep -ve '^ok'` to filter out passing tests)
2013-09-14 11:33:21	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: testem can handle any runner with a tap interface
2013-09-14 11:33:25	chrisdickinson	+1
2013-09-14 11:33:38	chrisdickinson	i think tape is specifically designed to be tap-compatible
2013-09-14 11:34:01	dlmanning	So it appears
2013-09-14 11:34:30	dlmanning	Testing stacks are confusing. I want the students to by in
2013-09-14 11:34:33	dlmanning	buy in
2013-09-14 11:34:38	chrisdickinson	a few things: write tape tests as `test("name", function(assert) { assert.end() })`
2013-09-14 11:34:59	chrisdickinson	(avoid `assert.plan(<num>)`, it feels really brittle over time)
2013-09-14 11:35:32	chrisdickinson	the more your tests are "just another javascript program", the easier it will be to move to other things down the line
2013-09-14 11:35:41	dlmanning	word
2013-09-14 11:35:43	chrisdickinson	(that is, the switching costs are lower)
2013-09-14 11:36:03	dlmanning	Do you have a recommendation for a documentation tool?
2013-09-14 11:36:25	dlmanning	I can't find any that don't make me want to punch myself
2013-09-14 11:36:54	chrisdickinson	hm
2013-09-14 11:36:57	chrisdickinson	what do you want it to do?
2013-09-14 11:37:27	dlmanning	I want to introduce a widely used documentation standard early on
2013-09-14 11:38:05	chrisdickinson	https://npmjs.org/package/function-comment
2013-09-14 11:38:06	dlmanning	To make people think about their api's before they write their code
2013-09-14 11:38:19	chrisdickinson	also: follow how substack's readmes are structured
2013-09-14 11:38:52	chrisdickinson	1 sentence description + example js, 1 paragraph deeper desc, API, topics, license
2013-09-14 11:39:11	chrisdickinson	"topics" are optional but encouraged
2013-09-14 11:39:22	chrisdickinson	(like, "here's how to do X with Y")
2013-09-14 11:39:59	dlmanning	Looks like function-comment is using jsdoc as a standard
2013-09-14 11:40:12	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: also, portfinder, amazing find
2013-09-14 11:40:18	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-09-14 11:40:20	Wraithan	going to add that to some of my projects
2013-09-14 11:41:34	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: dunno if it is or not actually! it might just be slurping up the preceding comment before functions
2013-09-14 11:42:43	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: true, it doesn't look like it's doing any parsing
2013-09-14 11:42:56	chrisdickinson	well, he's using esprima to give back the nearest node
2013-09-14 11:42:59	chrisdickinson	ah
2013-09-14 11:43:04	chrisdickinson	yeah of the comment itself no
2013-09-14 11:43:38	chrisdickinson	ah, interesting, yeah, it just gives back the comments
2013-09-14 11:44:27	chrisdickinson	i suppose you could combine it with https://npmjs.org/package/doctrine to good effect

2013-09-14 11:45:15	dlmanning	interesting
2013-09-14 11:46:59	dlmanning	So, alot of these tend to favor jsdoc as a documentation format
2013-09-14 11:49:14	dlmanning	implicitly or explicitly
2013-09-14 11:49:36	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-09-14 11:50:20	chrisdickinson	i'm kind of -1 on jsdoc since it feels like java / over-specification
2013-09-14 11:50:20	dlmanning	Too bad the jsdoc tool is such a chimera of awfulness
2013-09-14 11:50:48	dlmanning	It requires java and rhino
2013-09-14 11:50:54	dlmanning	I mean... RHINO!
2013-09-14 11:51:01	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-09-14 11:51:48	dlmanning	YUIDoc looks a little cleaner, but for some reason YUI stuff always makes me feel like I'm joining a cult
2013-09-14 11:52:29	chrisdickinson	haha, yeah
2013-09-14 11:52:37	chrisdickinson	so, what's the end goal of inline docs?
2013-09-14 11:52:51	chrisdickinson	is it to produce a separate artifact?
2013-09-14 11:52:59	dlmanning	Not really
2013-09-14 11:53:01	chrisdickinson	s/the end/your end/g
2013-09-14 11:53:21	chrisdickinson	(i am bad at phrasing things: "what do you want out of inline docs" is what i actually meant :))
2013-09-14 11:53:49	dlmanning	It's a discipline I'd like to enforce. Having a tool to process them means they have to learn to do them consistently
2013-09-14 11:54:18	dlmanning	And it's a neat reward incentive to see that they can produce pretty documentation with a command afterwards
2013-09-14 11:54:52	dlmanning	But if it's too much trouble it might not be worth it

2013-09-15 20:05:20	Wraithan	I know how to generate an artifact and I can commit that if I wanted to, but my index.html points index.js, which is the file that beefy is auto browserifying for me

2013-09-15 22:33:19	dlmanning	But I assume if involves being a connection for the students to ask about what it means to be a javascript developer

2013-09-17 11:28:24	Wraithan	I'm drinking cold brew made at woodlawn cafe, stumptown is the roaster so it is kinda generic but still good quality
2013-09-17 11:28:27	s5fs	hardly like real coffee at all. put enough chocolate in anything and it'll taste pretty good

2013-09-17 11:33:09	Wraithan	chrisdickinson, hackygolucky_, justinabrahms, JSON_voorhees, s5fs, everyone else going to cascadiajs, train tickets, shall we decide on a departure?
2013-09-17 11:33:17	hackygolucky_	ah
2013-09-17 11:33:28	 *	hackygolucky_ goes to check what the calendar looks like
2013-09-17 11:33:57	Wraithan	I'm thinking the day before, leave late morning (Depending on train departures)
2013-09-17 11:35:02	s5fs	Wraithan: i'm not going to cascadiajs unfortunately
2013-09-17 11:35:02	justinabrahms	There's no SO track for cascadia so I'm planning to abstain. :)
2013-09-17 11:35:19	chrisdickinson	+1 wednesday morning train
2013-09-17 11:35:27	 *	Wraithan didn't know who was going so I was just pinging all likely canidates
2013-09-17 11:35:27	justinabrahms	actually...
2013-09-17 11:36:16	justinabrahms	could possibly attend anyway. Will coordinate w/ hackygolucky_  :)
2013-09-17 11:36:30	Wraithan	Bah, the only non-stop is from 2:45pm to 10:50pm
2013-09-17 11:36:32	Wraithan	Which I'm down for
2013-09-17 11:36:47	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: sounds good to me. I could still work and just leave early for the train.
2013-09-17 11:37:10	Wraithan	I was hoping to save brain juice for train ahcking
2013-09-17 11:37:11	Wraithan	:)
2013-09-17 11:37:34	Wraithan	though I that onl amounts to 12 hours or so of hacking, which is doable

2013-09-17 11:38:45	Wraithan	webgl on rails.
2013-09-17 11:38:47	Wraithan	something like that
2013-09-17 11:38:54	Wraithan	we'll see what I am into at the point
2013-09-17 11:38:59	s5fs	yeah i saw you were playing with three.js, apparently that's all the rage eh?
2013-09-17 11:39:13	Wraithan	s5fs: it'd be more of a rage if the documentation wasn't shit
2013-09-17 11:39:19	s5fs	the code is the documentation!
2013-09-17 11:39:21	Wraithan	which as I learn more I'll fix it
2013-09-17 11:39:30	s5fs	see man, that's why we love you

2013-09-17 11:40:53	hackygolucky_	:(
2013-09-17 11:41:19	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: both ways or just the way back? I <3 trains so much
2013-09-17 11:41:37	Wraithan	but if $$ is an issue I can do bolt bus, rather be inclusive than exclusive
2013-09-17 11:41:42	Wraithan	especially for something silly like money
2013-09-17 11:42:11	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: I do too. But the way back, it's not just the money(twice the price). It's all transfers and buses/trains anyway.

2013-09-17 11:45:57	hackygolucky_	Done
2013-09-17 11:46:29	chrisdickinson	oh crap, gotta have passport info
2013-09-17 11:46:31	Wraithan	Also, open offer, anyone who needs me to buy them a ticket and can pay me back is welcome to do that. Rather get your seat set than have anyone have to take a different time because they sell out or something
2013-09-17 11:47:49	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: I think you have to have your passport info at the time of purchase
2013-09-17 11:48:02	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I see, well I have mine on me :)
2013-09-17 11:48:08	hackygolucky_	I just happen to have ours scanned and saved because well, it's good to have if it gets stolen abroad
2013-09-17 11:48:23	chrisdickinson	^^ i am stealing this idea.
2013-09-17 11:48:25	Wraithan	I have my passport card on me all the time

2013-09-17 11:55:42	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: I'm thinking boltbus. Insanely cheap and still pleasant.
2013-09-17 11:57:06	Wraithan	Also, ticket obtained
2013-09-17 11:57:17	Wraithan	Do we have a mailing list of any sort?
2013-09-17 11:57:37	hackygolucky_	the meetup
2013-09-17 11:57:42	hackygolucky_	but nah, otherwise.
2013-09-17 11:59:03	chrisdickinson	nothing has better UX than a group text, NOTHING

2013-09-17 12:00:57	s5fs	chrisdickinson: how do we not have a pdxnode webring?

2013-09-17 12:03:20	chrisdickinson	it's the first thing i think of in the morning, and i shed one tear for the lack of it every night before falling asleep.
2013-09-17 12:04:02	Wraithan	hitting up the vancouver mozilla irc channel to see how silly it is to bring a bike in middle of november
2013-09-17 12:06:16	Wraithan	yvr folks say it will just be rainy, a little rainier than pdx is at the same time
2013-09-17 12:06:27	s5fs	i figured
2013-09-17 12:06:31	Wraithan	so wool and/or rain gear
2013-09-17 12:06:39	Wraithan	and gloves
2013-09-17 12:06:40	Wraithan	lol
2013-09-17 12:07:00	Wraithan	I figured to, but I wanted to check with the folks who live there :)
2013-09-17 12:07:41	s5fs	always wise. i once went to idaho and didn't bring a jacket because it was warm here, big mistake.
2013-09-17 12:07:57	s5fs	"if its warm here, now, it'll be warm all the time, everywhere"
2013-09-17 12:08:18	Wraithan	hah
2013-09-17 12:08:44	Wraithan	that is like my friends who go camping in the summer here and don't bring layers
2013-09-17 12:10:50	s5fs	haha, heating up rocks by the fire and then putting them under yoru clothing to stay warm at night
2013-09-17 12:11:07	s5fs	that's camping bordering on elective homelessness
2013-09-17 12:11:07	Wraithan	hah
2013-09-17 12:11:11	Wraithan	:)
2013-09-17 12:11:23	s5fs	streams! natures bidet
2013-09-17 12:13:29	Wraithan	Why doesn't the cascadiajs site say where the conference actually is?
2013-09-17 12:15:17	s5fs	oh snap, i didn't know carter was an organizer, cool!
2013-09-17 12:16:23	Wraithan	yea
2013-09-17 12:16:32	Wraithan	I chatted with him at nodebotsday about tit

2013-09-17 16:22:24	hackygolucky_	I could only buy for justinabrahms because I had his passport info.

2013-09-17 16:23:01	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I was offering to buy for others, at which time I'd get their info from them so I can buy the ticket
2013-09-17 16:23:03	JSON_voorhees	I'll probably go omorrow

2013-09-18 10:34:14	Wraithan	they started going toward sails and I was like NOU!

2013-09-18 10:39:22	dlmanning	I think I just now got that 'sails' is a play on 'rails'
2013-09-18 10:39:56	dlmanning	Cause I'm sitting here thinking to myself, "Sails is a lot like someone's trying to make rails for node"

2013-09-19 11:41:21	chrisdickinson	hiiii
2013-09-19 11:41:27	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: pretty sure I found a regression in libuv, but I'm not exactly sure what to do about it
2013-09-19 11:41:43	chrisdickinson	oo, how so?
2013-09-19 11:42:04	dlmanning	https://gist.github.com/dlmanning/6618028
2013-09-19 11:42:22	dlmanning	This seems (to me) to vague to file an issue with
2013-09-19 11:42:26	dlmanning	to/too
2013-09-19 11:43:53	chrisdickinson	hm
2013-09-19 11:44:10	chrisdickinson	so, you're editing a.txt and sublime is making backup files
2013-09-19 11:44:21	dlmanning	yeah, that's happening
2013-09-19 11:44:37	dlmanning	but the point is that FSWatcher isn't emitting change events anymore
2013-09-19 11:44:52	chrisdickinson	hmm
2013-09-19 11:45:13	chrisdickinson	is sublime writing the file to the backup and then replacing the real file with that backup?
2013-09-19 11:45:43	dlmanning	I think so
2013-09-19 11:45:59	chrisdickinson	hmm
2013-09-19 11:46:19	dlmanning	It's probably doing automatic saves to the temp file then writing to the actual file when I save
2013-09-19 11:46:53	chrisdickinson	ah, i was wondering if it was doing automatic saves to the temp file then just `mv temp real` on save
2013-09-19 11:47:38	dlmanning	hmm
2013-09-19 11:49:25	dlmanning	Either way though, it was emitting change events on 0.10.17 but isn't on 0.10.18
2013-09-19 11:50:19	dlmanning	It "should", right?
2013-09-19 11:50:33	chrisdickinson	it kind of depends on what sublime's doing, i think
2013-09-19 11:51:05	chrisdickinson	it might be best to take sublime out of the picture and have a script that appends to a file, and another script that creates a temp file and replaces the file with mv
2013-09-19 11:51:34	dlmanning	I can try that
2013-09-19 11:59:28	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: 'touch a.txt' provokes a 'change' event. vim provokes a 'rename'. nano triggers 'change'
2013-09-19 12:14:04	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Wrote a little script to write a file from one place to another, seems to shake out like this:
2013-09-19 12:14:45	dlmanning	Create a new file: rename event. Write directly to an existing file: change event.
2013-09-19 12:15:03	dlmanning	Copy from one file to another: change event. Move from one file to another: rename event
2013-09-19 12:16:02	dlmanning	Should one consider this Working as Intended, given that it seems to break with the way most file editors operate?
2013-09-19 12:17:16	chrisdickinson	interesting!
2013-09-19 12:18:50	chrisdickinson	you might head to #libuv with a gist of your findings
2013-09-19 12:18:59	dlmanning	Tried

2013-09-19 13:09:32	adamdicarlo	unclear whether that allows #require-ing the same module from multiple modules without blowing up / duplicating code

2013-09-24 11:19:32	s5fs	oh man, i finally fixed a long-standing issue with my wifi on this laptop
2013-09-24 11:19:57	s5fs	power management doesn't work right with this chipset, so it'll put the card to sleep for a few seconds at a time, totally bizarro
2013-09-24 11:20:29	Wraithan	s5fs: the BBB lets you use a mini usb for the same purpose without a special cable
2013-09-24 11:20:32	s5fs	when running a ping, it would time out 11 times before resuming, every time
2013-09-24 11:20:49	s5fs	Wraithan: heh, i haven't tried
2013-09-24 11:21:11	Wraithan	I should get one of those serial cables though, you are right
2013-09-24 11:21:21	s5fs	its super useful for so many applications
2013-09-24 11:22:24	s5fs	i know usb works the same in many cases, but lets be honest, a few colorful wires plugged into gpio pins just looks way more badass at a coffeeshop
2013-09-24 11:22:34	Wraithan	s5fs: oh you have to use the standard gpio for it?
2013-09-24 11:22:43	Wraithan	Lame :(
2013-09-24 11:23:02	Wraithan	the rpi already is limited in its gpio

2013-09-24 11:24:03	Wraithan	I leave a ribbon connected to that, would have to connect on my breadboard I guess
2013-09-24 11:24:06	s5fs	depends on the device. on the pi it eats up gpio pins but on the bbb it has separate pins for serial comm
2013-09-24 11:25:04	s5fs	yeah, and my application is different too, i like to connect wireless stuff and just use the rpi/bbb as a gateway node
2013-09-24 11:25:19	s5fs	i haven't connected much gear directly to a pi yet, no need
2013-09-24 11:26:11	Wraithan	Ah, I've been using it for experimenting with new gear (especially using the BBB for that)
2013-09-24 11:26:49	Wraithan	I run low on gpio when playing with my LED bars and stuff, which is why I am getting into shift registers
2013-09-24 11:30:37	s5fs	ah, that makes sense

2013-09-24 13:33:20	Wraithan	I will of course customize it and everything
2013-09-24 13:34:24	s5fs	nope, not cheating at all

2013-09-25 14:52:15	s5fs	hackygolucky_: yeah i saw that gist, and the prior article from strongloop. i hate this shit, feels like office politics.
2013-09-25 14:54:16	hackygolucky_	yeah, I'm happy that they seem to be having healthy dialogue. But... node doesn't need this.
2013-09-25 14:55:40	s5fs	its C-levels lobbing PR bombs across the fence as a way to celebrate landing some funding
2013-09-25 14:56:31	s5fs	even in free software development someone has to make it about the money, ain't that some shit?
2013-09-25 14:57:15	s5fs	to me this whole thing is a huge turn-off, esp to strongloop. hell of a way to win friends.

2013-09-25 17:40:07	s5fs	strongloop is interesting, they're selling a certified version of node and a bunch of supported modules: http://strongloop.com/strongloop-suite/strongnode/
2013-09-25 17:40:24	s5fs	its an interesting concept and one i can see very attractive to business customers who are out of the loop (pun unintended)

2013-09-25 22:25:14	dlmanning	Al Zimmerman (the Ruby instructor) and I are on the same page about what terms we'll accept, so basically at this point that can either agree with us or not have their school this term

2013-09-26 10:47:51	Wraithan	Sure, and it probably would have been fine, but contacting them and seeing them stick to their guns, that is pretty disturbing
2013-09-26 10:49:21	s5fs	yup, always better to ask forgiveness in a case like that
2013-09-26 10:49:38	Wraithan	I don't think so
2013-09-26 10:50:54	s5fs	its my understanding that non-competes are hard to enforce in many states, including oregon
2013-09-26 10:51:08	Wraithan	You date a girl and she happens to mention that she doesn't want you to date anyone else for 3 years, regardless of your status, then you are like "yeah but you don't really mean that" and her answer is "well, actually I do, for at least a year"
2013-09-26 10:51:32	Wraithan	at first you think it is some blanket silly thing, but then you realize they actually mean it
2013-09-26 10:51:45	Wraithan	s5fs: just because it is easy to get thrown out doesn't mean litigation doesn't cost anything
2013-09-26 10:51:54	s5fs	sure but we've broken up, so the potential damage is fairly limited
2013-09-26 10:52:17	s5fs	Wraithan: oh i totally agree there is risk that they'll push for a trial, but again, that seems really really unlikely
2013-09-26 10:52:53	Wraithan	It isn't that she would actually have a say, it is that she wants and thinks she'll get a say
2013-09-26 10:53:16	Wraithan	The fact that they think it is alright, is itself not alright
2013-09-26 10:53:28	s5fs	agreed, but people make all kinds of unreasonable requests
2013-09-26 10:54:04	s5fs	i won't be working for burnside digital anytime soon, that much is true
2013-09-26 10:55:14	s5fs	mainly i'm just bummed david has to put up with that shit, esp if it hurts his employment options
2013-09-26 10:56:06	s5fs	ohh wait, is he not currently under the non-compete? i missed that part haha!
2013-09-26 10:56:45	s5fs	yeah shit, if he's on the unsigned end of the contract, push for better terms
2013-09-26 10:56:55	Wraithan	s5fs: yeah, he is fighting against it being in the contract before he, or the ruby teacher will sign
2013-09-26 10:57:15	Wraithan	:)
2013-09-26 10:57:15	s5fs	what exactly would he not be competing with them over, trade secrets?
2013-09-26 10:57:32	Wraithan	exactly. there is nothing for them to have that in there
2013-09-26 10:57:45	s5fs	i'd assume it would be nearly impossible to enforce in a teaching setting, esp if he's coming up with the coursework
2013-09-26 10:58:05	Wraithan	s5fs: even more especially as a contractor (vs full time employee)
2013-09-26 10:58:40	Wraithan	as well as him being a teacher already, and having already given talks at user groups and such
2013-09-26 10:59:02	Wraithan	There is literally no reason to have that clause
2013-09-26 10:59:30	s5fs	indy contractors don't have to sign non-competes because they aren't part of the organization
2013-09-26 10:59:39	s5fs	that's totally unenforceable
2013-09-26 11:00:28	s5fs	contractors exist to service multiple customers, often in the same industry
2013-09-26 11:00:36	Wraithan	exactly
2013-09-26 11:01:42	Wraithan	and yeah, I agree, I wont be working with burnside digital anytime soon. PCS as a mentor or for teaching a single lesson or something, I can deal with because my understanding is BD is super hands off
2013-09-26 11:02:30	s5fs	well, if anything it makes BD sound a bit silly. they must not have in-house legal otherwise this would've been knocked down. even hr should know that this isn't enforceable.
2013-09-26 11:03:16	Wraithan	Anyone in the industry for more than a couple years knows that
2013-09-26 11:03:26	Wraithan	this isn't new york
2013-09-26 11:03:32	Wraithan	you can't enforce that stuff

2013-09-26 11:14:53	dlmanning	As you guys have surmised, my main thing here is "What sort of people are these?"
2013-09-26 11:15:24	s5fs	dlmanning: i'm guessing "uninformed"
2013-09-26 11:15:39	s5fs	anyone can download boilerplate and ask folks to sign it
2013-09-26 11:15:39	dlmanning	I know they can't enforce this ridiculousness, but I don't really want to have to go to court to sort that out
2013-09-26 11:16:01	dlmanning	Neither do I want the anxiety of feeling like I'm looking over my shoulder for them for a year
2013-09-26 11:16:04	s5fs	dlmanning: you are an independent consultant, right?
2013-09-26 11:16:06	dlmanning	yup
2013-09-26 11:16:24	s5fs	do they have an HR person? legal staff?
2013-09-26 11:16:34	dlmanning	I don't know
2013-09-26 11:16:48	dlmanning	They said they just hired a new lawyer
2013-09-26 11:17:25	dlmanning	They have a development staff... of sorts... here in Portland, but all the people who can make decisions seem to be remote
2013-09-26 11:17:45	dlmanning	We've been dealing with a guy in LA
2013-09-26 11:18:10	dlmanning	Frankly, it seems a little shady
2013-09-26 11:19:12	dlmanning	The thing is, I don't exactly *need* this job. I really want to teach the class, but if they're willing to burn down the school over this, I'll be borderline amused
2013-09-26 11:19:23	s5fs	dlmanning: laws http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/653.295
2013-09-26 11:19:33	s5fs	they're just plain wrong
2013-09-26 11:19:50	s5fs	its in their best interest to get this issue resolved
2013-09-26 11:20:58	dlmanning	yup
2013-09-26 11:23:21	s5fs	haha, oregon law says a non-compete can only extend two years anyways, gotta love it

2013-09-26 11:25:19	dlmanning	The other issue is that they want the title to the course materials we produce
2013-09-26 11:25:26	dlmanning	We're not going to give them that
2013-09-26 11:26:58	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: this makes me sad.
2013-09-26 11:27:47	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: Don't be sad until its over. I still think they'll cave
2013-09-26 11:28:24	dlmanning	And if they don't, better that people like that shouldn't run a training school
2013-09-26 11:28:25	hackygolucky_	They have to. They have to...
2013-09-26 11:28:31	hackygolucky_	right.
2013-09-26 11:28:41	dlmanning	Something better will take their place
2013-09-26 11:29:12	hackygolucky_	and we're blessed to have jobs in the meantime :)
2013-09-26 11:29:21	dlmanning	yup
2013-09-26 11:30:03	dlmanning	But like I said, I think they'll cave

2013-09-26 13:08:27	Wraithan	I work on a really wide range of projects, most of which, while open source, aren't really that helpful to people
2013-09-26 14:04:40	nvcexploder	Wraithan: I'm going to be doing some BBB hacking this weekend, and haven't used mine yet, just the old version.
2013-09-26 14:05:13	nvcexploder	Wraithan: any tips on it? Should I change the OS to a different one? What did you use to set it up (OS, running Node, etc…)?
2013-09-26 14:05:43	Wraithan	nvcexploder: I just used angstrom (the distro that came on it)
2013-09-26 14:06:11	Wraithan	nvcexploder: I've not done much other than playing with hardware that doesn't require high speeds
2013-09-26 14:06:13	nvcexploder	kk
2013-09-26 14:06:48	Wraithan	I stick to C for things like my range finder and such because I need sub ms resolution for accurate readings
2013-09-26 14:10:15	dlmanning	yeah
2013-09-26 14:17:28	nvcexploder	k. I haven't done anything in c on micro controllers. :(
2013-09-26 14:17:38	nvcexploder	or anything in C in about 10 years.
2013-09-26 14:18:24	Wraithan	Well, most applications node or other high level languages are fast enough
2013-09-26 14:19:30	Wraithan	Their node api isn't bad, feels arduino-ish

2013-09-26 14:43:45	dlmanning	Crisis averted

2013-09-26 14:48:23	dlmanning	I did
2013-09-26 14:49:20	Wraithan	nice
2013-09-26 14:49:22	dlmanning	In place of transferring the title to our materials, we lifted the language from node.js's contributor liscense agreement :)
2013-09-26 14:49:44	dlmanning	I also used the phrase "good open source citizen"
2013-09-26 14:49:46	Wraithan	ah so they get an unlimited license to it
2013-09-26 14:50:03	dlmanning	yeah, which I'm totally fine with
2013-09-26 14:50:09	Wraithan	(I've not read the node CLA, just assuming it is like every other one)
2013-09-26 14:50:23	Wraithan	Yeah, totally reasonable
2013-09-26 14:50:32	dlmanning	Their concern was mostly that we not be able to leave and take away their access to class materials
2013-09-26 14:50:39	Wraithan	ah
2013-09-26 14:50:43	Wraithan	yea, legit concern

2013-09-27 14:33:04	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: You favor named callbacks at the top of functions rather than at the end, eh?
2013-09-27 14:34:33	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: I find it interesting to work with that style because it's almost like I have a glossary of methods below if I need more context.
2013-09-27 14:34:38	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: at the end
2013-09-27 14:35:22	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: oh, I was thinking of our hoisting. nm. I'm very done talk today :)
2013-09-27 14:36:12	chrisdickinson	yeah, i've found that it's way easier to keep things flat and straightforward when you are dogmatic about ripping out anonymous functions into named functions whenever possible
2013-09-27 14:36:38	chrisdickinson	and ideally, if they happen after the current event loop turn, they go after the return statement of the function they're defined in
2013-09-27 14:37:04	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Oh, one of your slides said they were hoisted
2013-09-27 14:37:10	hackygolucky_	s/talk/talking
2013-09-27 14:37:17	chrisdickinson	yep
2013-09-27 14:37:40	dlmanning	But... after the return statement != hoisted
2013-09-27 14:37:46	chrisdickinson	how so?
2013-09-27 14:37:47	dlmanning	Or am I missing something
2013-09-27 14:37:52	chrisdickinson	we may have differing definitions
2013-09-27 14:37:56	dlmanning	we may
2013-09-27 14:38:20	chrisdickinson	function statements make their associated functions available to the entirety of the scope in which they are defined immediately upon entering the scope
2013-09-27 14:38:25	chrisdickinson	(vs. var statements)
2013-09-27 14:38:44	dlmanning	Yes
2013-09-27 14:38:53	chrisdickinson	i've described this behavior as "hoisting", in that it's as if, despite being defined N lines below, the function definition is pulled/"hoisted" to the first line of the enclosing scope.
2013-09-27 14:38:55	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: how would you feel about giving that talk at pdxnode?
2013-09-27 14:39:00	chrisdickinson	would love to!
2013-09-27 14:39:21	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Ah! So you're referencing the action of the interpreter
2013-09-27 14:39:31	hackygolucky_	I think fellow javascripters would appreciate it even more than airshippers.
2013-09-27 14:40:18	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I understood the slide to mean that your style guide was dictating the function declarations be hoisted explictly by the author of the code
2013-09-27 14:40:22	chrisdickinson	oh!
2013-09-27 14:40:25	chrisdickinson	nope :)

2013-09-27 14:41:06	dlmanning	Yeah, I know they get hoisted automatically, just misunderstood
2013-09-27 14:41:19	dlmanning	My bad, carry on :)
2013-09-27 14:41:19	hackygolucky_	:) do you know how often I get asked if I'm a recruiter? :(

2013-09-27 14:42:39	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i'd take that as a compliment
2013-09-27 14:42:43	hackygolucky_	I talk about what I know. I don't know coding confidently. I do confidently like working at UA. heh.
2013-09-27 14:43:06	hackygolucky_	well, until I get the 'do you even touch production code?' question
2013-09-27 14:43:10	s5fs	hackygolucky_: for every person who knows programming "well" there is someone who still thinks of them as a noob
2013-09-27 14:43:24	hackygolucky_	heh. yeah yeah.
2013-09-27 14:43:55	dlmanning	And that someone is Linus Torvalds
2013-09-27 14:44:13	s5fs	even torvalds is no bill joy
2013-09-27 14:45:24	hackygolucky_	:D
2013-09-27 14:45:56	dlmanning	or Donald Knuth
2013-09-27 14:48:52	s5fs	dlmanning: funny, i didn't use knuth as an example because he hasn't created an os
2013-09-27 14:51:01	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: if the presentation night is Oct. 10, would you be able to give your talk?
2013-09-27 14:51:13	s5fs	but yes, anyone who legitimately wrote the book(s) on anything is pretty awesome
2013-09-27 14:51:52	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky_: i think so yes
2013-09-27 14:52:30	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: is it possible to get Mozilla reserved for Oct. 10?

2013-09-30 15:45:56	s5fs	hackygolucky_: barely. power went out in my area, trapping me inside of a safeway.
2013-09-30 15:46:05	s5fs	no power at home from 1p-9:30p or something

2013-09-30 15:46:37	hackygolucky_	I was on the train last night and I thought we'd get delayed. trees were bending sideways and visibility was awful.
2013-09-30 15:46:41	s5fs	i have to check the damage when i get home, but we keep stuff off the ground in preparation for sitautions like that

2013-10-01 11:12:51	s5fs	faddah: whatcha been up to man
2013-10-01 11:27:23	faddah	oh, stuff. still could use your help on the last part of that coding issue. still is coming out, in console log, or if i put it to innerHTML, with the extra Object keys and " quote marks and commas ','.
2013-10-01 11:27:33	faddah	that was for s5fs, btw
2013-10-01 11:28:09	faddah	s5fs - also, was in a o'reilly webcast this morn.
2013-10-01 11:28:17	s5fs	faddah: got a pen or fiddle?
2013-10-01 11:28:22	s5fs	faddah: awesome man, what was the topic?
2013-10-01 11:29:45	faddah	s5fs - v. anton spraul on problem solving to promote his no-starch press o'reilly book, “think like a programmer.” it was good. think maybe you and i should give a talk on that, it's along the lines of what we've been talking about (“break it down simpler and use console.log, man!”).  ;)
2013-10-01 11:30:15	faddah	s5fs - i'll get it up in a pen, sure. just let me finish breakies. hungry.  ;)
2013-10-01 11:30:48	s5fs	i had two cuppa joe so i'm good for a while. oddly, i tend to fast for 12-14hrs every day, just kinda happens
2013-10-01 11:31:33	Wraithan	mornin
2013-10-01 11:32:02	faddah	s5fs - pooh. not good for the metabolism, many. body needs fuel.
2013-10-01 11:32:27	faddah	s5fs - that was supposed to be “ooooh,” not “pooh.” blecch.
2013-10-01 11:32:30	s5fs	faddah: i've read a lot about timing nutrition and for each study that says eating on a schedule is helpful, another one counters that
2013-10-01 11:32:40	Wraithan	intermittent fasting, much like many small meals is just a trick to deal with caloric intake
2013-10-01 11:32:44	s5fs	faddah: so, i just listen to my body and eat when i'm hungry
2013-10-01 11:32:59	s5fs	if i'm gunna lift a car off a burning baby, i'll prob eat something beforehand
2013-10-01 11:33:07	faddah	s5fs - shrug. ok.
2013-10-01 11:33:09	Wraithan	there is no proof to make it better in either direction
2013-10-01 11:33:24	s5fs	that's the thing about fitness, people's bodies are all different
2013-10-01 11:33:35	Wraithan	s5fs: wat. no wai
2013-10-01 11:33:41	Wraithan	:)
2013-10-01 11:33:49	s5fs	haha crazy right
2013-10-01 11:34:18	Wraithan	Yeah, I have been fasting 16 hours a day, losing weight, gaining muscle and no fatigue
2013-10-01 11:34:24	faddah	s5fs - i like to be prepared. lots of burning cars and babies in my neighborhood.  :o
2013-10-01 11:34:51	s5fs	faddah: ultimately we gotta find something that works for us and go with it
2013-10-01 11:35:02	Wraithan	I am still getting about 2100 calories today, 120g protein, 20g carbs and the rest oils
2013-10-01 11:35:04	s5fs	i'm sedentary right now so i don't need nearly as much food as i did when i was active
2013-10-01 11:35:21	s5fs	i prob take in 1600-1800kcal/day and need less than that to maintain
2013-10-01 11:35:54	Wraithan	Yeah, if I wasn't working out (basically) ever other day, I'd probably drop down a little to 1900-2000
2013-10-01 11:36:29	s5fs	i'm only doing a teensy bit of bw stuff right now, barely enough to keep my joints from creaking
2013-10-01 11:36:47	Wraithan	<3 bw stuff
2013-10-01 11:36:50	s5fs	faddah: all my focus is in my studies, i don't do well with balance unfortunately
2013-10-01 11:37:35	s5fs	yeah, prison squats, lunges, pushups, pullups, chinups.. that's my routine, takes about 15min if i do the whole thing. i'm not tracking anything atm, but i should.
2013-10-01 11:37:44	faddah	s5fs - not trying to say you should be one way or another man. just everyone i've ever gone to for training says its important to refuel, even small bits (an apple, say). but if it works for you, it works for you.
2013-10-01 11:38:28	Wraithan	Lots of the fitness world is still afraid of eating fat too

2013-10-01 11:38:33	Wraithan	which is silly
2013-10-01 11:38:34	s5fs	faddah: if i'm expending energy then i'll refuel, totally agree. since i'm sitting on my ass it seems like one meal a day is adequate, i usually supplement with coffee or tea to keep things moving. i mainly eat in the evenings.
2013-10-01 11:38:40	s5fs	dude, i eat so much fat, it's awesome
2013-10-01 11:38:46	Wraithan	s5fs: srsly
2013-10-01 11:38:48	s5fs	dietary fat makes you feel full longer
2013-10-01 11:38:59	Wraithan	and way more even energy levels
2013-10-01 11:39:13	faddah	s5fs & Wraithan - people tell me when i push myself and don't eat while coding or writing something, i get grumpy. at which point, i usually pop them one in the nose for saying that.
2013-10-01 11:39:27	s5fs	faddah: haha! yeah, gotta watch out for "hangry" that's for sure
2013-10-01 11:39:40	s5fs	i too get hangry, and i also get pissy when problems aren't easy and someone interrupts me
2013-10-01 11:40:01	s5fs	but i also believe there is an upper limit for how long one can code in a day and still generate good quality work
2013-10-01 11:40:03	Wraithan	faddah: that is a valid concern, usually that is borne from low blood sugar at a time when your body is used to high blood sugar
2013-10-01 11:40:11	s5fs	at a certain point i go slowblind and cannot use vim
2013-10-01 11:40:20	s5fs	*snowblind
2013-10-01 11:40:24	Wraithan	definitely
2013-10-01 11:40:31	Wraithan	you can raise that amount with practice
2013-10-01 11:40:49	Wraithan	but yeah, like with physical things there is an endurance
2013-10-01 11:40:52	faddah	s5fs & Wraithan - i'm not afraid of fat, eating wise - this morning, 3 eggs, including duck egg a friend gave me, two strips applewood bacon, 1/4 turkey burger, coffee. trainer says i need big breakfast and more protein, less carbs.
2013-10-01 11:41:08	Wraithan	yeah, fuck carbs
2013-10-01 11:41:10	Wraithan	lol
2013-10-01 11:41:15	s5fs	but they're so delicious!
2013-10-01 11:41:29	Wraithan	the carbiest things I eat these days is popcorn
2013-10-01 11:41:33	Wraithan	and occasionally a little bit of rice

2013-10-01 11:41:39	Wraithan	but rice is basically like eating sugar
2013-10-01 11:41:48	s5fs	i love rice
2013-10-01 11:41:55	s5fs	i almost brought rice to your place to eat with the pork
2013-10-01 11:42:13	Wraithan	white rice can be metabolized as fast or faster than table sugar
2013-10-01 11:42:16	faddah	salty carbs are my trigger & downfall. potato chips, fries, tots, corn chips, nachos, etc. i could literally bury my face in any of that and not come up for air.
2013-10-01 11:42:32	adamdicarlo	doesn't brown rice balance its carb load fairly decent?
2013-10-01 11:42:40	s5fs	faddah: damn right, i love crispy snax
2013-10-01 11:42:47	s5fs	adamdicarlo: beats me, its like eating cardboard
2013-10-01 11:42:56	adamdicarlo	mmm, cardboard.
2013-10-01 11:43:01	faddah	s5fs - they're part of the reason i used to be +45 lbs. heavier.
2013-10-01 11:43:08	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: it is a bit better, but still pretty high on the glycemic index
2013-10-01 11:43:13	s5fs	faddah: haha, that's a crazy mental image
2013-10-01 11:43:16	 *	adamdicarlo nods
2013-10-01 11:43:22	faddah	so i just limit those now. not cut out, just aware of the intake vs. activity.
2013-10-01 11:43:29	adamdicarlo	eating a good amount of fiber seems to help me with cravings in general
2013-10-01 11:43:48	adamdicarlo	like, rice + beans are a kind of perfect food...
2013-10-01 11:43:50	adamdicarlo	togetehr
2013-10-01 11:44:08	 *	faddah hands adamdicarlo some textile swaths and a fork. “have at it.”
2013-10-01 11:44:37	faddah	oh, properly done new orleans style red beans and rice are just the best.
2013-10-01 11:44:43	s5fs	adamdicarlo: yup, i was thinking about making some this evening, actually (red beans & rice)
2013-10-01 11:45:09	faddah	tom waits sings about red beans and rice. so, that's like, from the mouth of the buddha.
2013-10-01 11:45:25	s5fs	now that guy is a character
2013-10-01 11:45:54	s5fs	they serve red beans up at the sweet hereafter?
2013-10-01 11:46:21	faddah	s5fs - he is. he's also the buddha. i lived in his neighborhood before they tore down the tropicana hotel where he and rickie lee were living and moved ben franks up to sunset blvd.
2013-10-01 11:46:54	s5fs	that's neat man, when was that?
2013-10-01 11:47:34	faddah	oh god, mid 80s?
2013-10-01 11:47:45	faddah	i'm frriggin' old(e).
2013-10-01 11:47:49	faddah	like ye olde.
2013-10-01 11:48:10	s5fs	haha! back when people didn't cut their hair and wore lots of leather
2013-10-01 11:48:18	s5fs	and leopard print
2013-10-01 11:48:22	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: lots of spinach, arugala, broccoli and asperagus in my diet for fiber
2013-10-01 11:48:36	faddah	tropicana was a big rock 'n' roll / prostitute hotel on santa monica blvd. in west hollywood. got torn down late 80s i think?
2013-10-01 11:48:38	s5fs	i hate dark greens
2013-10-01 11:48:52	faddah	fancy-schmancy strip mall now with frou frou boutiques.
2013-10-01 11:49:00	s5fs	that sounds about right
2013-10-01 11:49:19	faddah	i dunno.
2013-10-01 11:49:26	faddah	i lived through it. but not in it.

2013-10-01 11:49:40	Wraithan	so good
2013-10-01 11:49:56	faddah	that's why my blog is called “i also went…” - feel like i've been witness to and tangental to many things, tho' not a true participant in them.
2013-10-01 11:50:24	faddah	anyway, lemme get that pen or fiddle up
2013-10-01 11:50:37	faddah	i'll direct message you, s5fs. thanx

2013-10-01 12:04:56	faddah	s5fs & Wraithan - depends on the cheese. sometimes, the cheese stands alone, man. the cheese stands alone.
2013-10-01 12:05:56	faddah	btw - here's a smile:  ha! her boss should have paid more attention to employee morale. good on her & now she has a video w/ 5 mil + hits on her reel. got this from cheezburger.com.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew_tdY0V4Zo

2013-10-02 12:50:44	likesalmon	Can't trust those guys.
2013-10-02 12:50:59	s5fs	nah, but i guarantee i'll see them less than once a year
2013-10-02 12:51:10	likesalmon	Yep
2013-10-02 12:51:26	s5fs	i had friends move from downtown to beav, i helped them move. saw 'em 4x.
2013-10-02 12:51:41	likesalmon	Yeah, it's like a different planet
2013-10-02 12:51:58	likesalmon	I've been noticing a lot of folks from WAY out of town at meetups
2013-10-02 12:51:59	s5fs	i hate driving and run in tight circles now
2013-10-02 12:52:13	likesalmon	I can see my office from my apartment
2013-10-02 12:52:28	likesalmon	I thought it would suck but it's actually amazing
2013-10-02 12:52:28	s5fs	i'm wfh today, my apt is my office
2013-10-02 12:52:37	likesalmon	Even better!
2013-10-02 12:52:47	s5fs	yeah but where do I go after work? haha!
2013-10-02 12:53:05	likesalmon	Kitchen?
2013-10-02 12:53:15	s5fs	haha!
2013-10-02 12:54:00	Wraithan	work? pffft that's for suckers
2013-10-02 12:54:09	s5fs	Wraithan: rub it in
2013-10-02 12:54:19	Wraithan	<3
2013-10-02 12:54:39	ericholscher	i'm "working"
2013-10-02 12:54:41	s5fs	man i'm using a diff keyboard today and it sucks
2013-10-02 12:54:48	Wraithan	what keyboard?
2013-10-02 12:55:00	Wraithan	I am a major keyboard nerd
2013-10-02 12:55:14	s5fs	i totally gotta get some work done. i finally carved off some work that isn't dependent on the shit-ass hw i've been given so i'm wfh and keepin it real easy
2013-10-02 12:55:17	s5fs	ms nat
2013-10-02 12:55:45	Wraithan	ah
2013-10-02 12:55:49	Wraithan	squishy keys :(
2013-10-02 12:55:50	s5fs	i prefer the logitech k120, nothing fancy at all
2013-10-02 12:56:02	s5fs	seriously squishy, i remember it being really nice but wtf
2013-10-02 12:56:11	s5fs	my hands are exhausted already
2013-10-02 12:56:28	s5fs	fuggit, i'm going couch-mando
2013-10-02 12:57:08	Wraithan	the logitech is still rubber domes, just a bit higher weight
2013-10-02 12:57:10	s5fs	double fuggit, i'm ordering another k120
2013-10-02 12:57:36	s5fs	yeah but the k120 is used by a ton of my enterprise clients, so when i show up i can still type like a banshee
2013-10-02 12:58:15	s5fs	its less the feel and more the consistency of my env that keeps me efficient. if i'm thinking about my gear while working, then i'm already losing.
2013-10-02 12:58:31	Wraithan	True
2013-10-02 12:58:35	Wraithan	I just carry gear with me
2013-10-02 12:59:46	s5fs	Wraithan: oh yeah? http://i.imgur.com/qbtHgBU.jpg
2013-10-02 13:00:26	s5fs	Wraithan: also, i give up on #orlug
2013-10-02 13:00:41	Wraithan	haha
2013-10-02 13:00:44	Wraithan	that's totally me
2013-10-02 13:00:59	drueck	lol at that photo
2013-10-02 13:01:00	Wraithan	dem mcwraps
2013-10-02 13:01:06	Wraithan	haha
2013-10-02 13:01:43	s5fs	i wonder how many trips it took him to set that up
2013-10-02 13:01:45	Wraithan	Now that I am back on my macbookair, I can actually start carrying a keyboard with me again... though I am not always into that
2013-10-02 13:02:08	s5fs	Wraithan: what do you prefer for a keyboard? i'm guessing something mechanical with a certain type of cherry switch, haha
2013-10-02 13:02:22	s5fs	"oh see that dome there? no good."
2013-10-02 13:02:56	s5fs	"this switch here was manufactured, by hand, and then aged 120 days in a cold freezer before being installed and tested by a virgin monk"
2013-10-02 13:03:08	Wraithan	https://d22d7v2y1t140g.cloudfront.net/m_1214561_RxuZmUmA3NOf.jpg
2013-10-02 13:03:26	Wraithan	The answer to how many trips it took
2013-10-02 13:03:29	s5fs	haha!!
2013-10-02 13:03:53	s5fs	http://cdn.nwgimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/failwin_picdump_312_640_11.jpg
2013-10-02 13:03:58	Wraithan	s5fs: Yes, I am a cherry fan, though I am typing on topres right now
2013-10-02 13:04:01	s5fs	<3 that free wifi
2013-10-02 13:04:41	s5fs	i don't know much about keyboards, just enough to think i'm clever
2013-10-02 13:04:44	Wraithan	http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,tenkeyless&pid=fc200rtab
2013-10-02 13:04:52	Wraithan	That is probably my favorite standard layout keyboard
2013-10-02 13:05:05	Wraithan	http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm
2013-10-02 13:05:29	Wraithan	is my favorite keyboard, but it isn't great for gaming
2013-10-02 13:05:42	s5fs	agreed, the standard keyboard is awesome, love the location of pgup/pgdown
2013-10-02 13:06:00	s5fs	those kinesis are strange, my buddy said they were super popular at jive
2013-10-02 13:06:07	Wraithan	I <3 them
2013-10-02 13:06:09	s5fs	fingers almost sit in a bowl
2013-10-02 13:06:21	Wraithan	yup
2013-10-02 13:06:31	s5fs	okay its 1p and i'm full of coffee, time to hack for reals
2013-10-02 13:06:32	Wraithan	next time I have a hack day at my house you can try out mine
2013-10-02 13:06:35	s5fs	yeah for sure!
2013-10-02 13:06:41	s5fs	i'm more interested in that standard keyboard tbh
2013-10-02 13:06:52	s5fs	i transition between keyboard and laptop keys so i don't wanna get too exotic
2013-10-02 13:06:53	Wraithan	I have a few mechanicals you can try if youwant
2013-10-02 13:07:04	s5fs	i still <3 the k120, its dirty cheap
2013-10-02 13:07:14	s5fs	but i'm game for carrying a keyboard with me, i'm really okay with that
2013-10-02 13:07:22	s5fs	i carried two laptops for two years
2013-10-02 13:07:47	s5fs	(didn't wanna pollute my linux env with windows)
2013-10-02 13:08:25	adamdicarlo	goldtouch is my fave keyboard: http://www.goldtouch.com/c-1-ergonomic-keyboards.aspx
2013-10-02 13:10:15	s5fs	i love goooooolllllllld adamdicarlo
2013-10-02 13:10:35	s5fs	would be better if it came in an C3PO model
2013-10-02 13:10:36	adamdicarlo	hee hee :) I contemplate buying the travel edition once in a while
2013-10-02 13:10:41	Wraithan	doesn't talk about switches, which means it is probably a garbage keyboard with a nice lift thing in the back
2013-10-02 13:10:56	adamdicarlo	haha, gold-plated gold touch? would make even those iphone 5s gold owners jelly ;)
2013-10-02 13:11:20	s5fs	I can't wait for the 6c
2013-10-02 13:11:31	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, it has a ball joint that connects the top inner corners.
2013-10-02 13:11:35	s5fs	its a 6c 6c iphone its a 6c 6c iphone
2013-10-02 13:11:59	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: sure, but doesn't fix the fact that they probably use terrible switches in it
2013-10-02 13:12:40	s5fs	adamdicarlo: those are neat, i've seen 'em before in offices who pay ergo specialists to set up workstations. they're surprisingly solid once you set an angle too, i was impressed.
2013-10-02 13:12:55	Wraithan	I want to know why there aren't more ergo keyboards with really nice switches in them
2013-10-02 13:12:58	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, yeah, I'm not sure -- I like the key action just fine, though from what I've read about "how far the key needs to be pushed before it actuates" it's likely not the best... it *is* a fairly loud keyboard (which...bodes well?)
2013-10-02 13:13:15	Wraithan	the switches make a huge amount of difference for joint fatigue
2013-10-02 13:13:27	s5fs	Wraithan: i'd love to start a shop that only sells high quality computing gear aimed at professionals
2013-10-02 13:13:51	adamdicarlo	s5fs, yes, for sure. when i'm on my Swopper or at a standing desk i prop the front of each edge up with a sliver of a 1x4 to give a nice reverse incline... and put my mouse on an empty ~1" binder to match
2013-10-02 13:14:05	s5fs	i figure the next couple of years most consumers will move towards some form of tablet/personal internet tv/etc and "real laptops" will be left back for pros
2013-10-02 13:14:07	adamdicarlo	(Swopper sits a lot higher than normal office chair)
2013-10-02 13:14:30	adamdicarlo	s5fs, and RSIs from looking down at tablets all the time will skyrocket :/
2013-10-02 13:14:38	s5fs	jeez man, i'm sitting on two folded up shitty pillows on a folding chair with a too-tall desk
2013-10-02 13:14:48	adamdicarlo	lol
2013-10-02 13:15:28	s5fs	i imagine you in some lofty well-lit office with floor-to-ceiling windows standing at your desk with a fancy keyboard
2013-10-02 13:15:42	s5fs	lots of glass and steel, exposed something-or-others
2013-10-02 13:16:10	s5fs	but i rest easy in the fact that you F5 your browser just like everyone else ;-)
2013-10-02 13:16:12	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: looked into it, the older ones have mechanical switches in them but the ball joint dies pretty fast, the newer ones are way more solid build, and use some of the highest quality rubber dome switches, but is still rubber dome
2013-10-02 13:16:16	Wraithan	55g activation
2013-10-02 13:16:20	Wraithan	which is a bit high for me
2013-10-02 13:16:38	s5fs	Wraithan: what action do you prefer?
2013-10-02 13:16:57	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, nice, interesting -- I have older ones, and must be why I have read the newer ones' key action sucks :(
2013-10-02 13:16:58	Wraithan	45g 2mm activation, 3-4mm full depth
2013-10-02 13:17:16	s5fs	yeah i'm finding i like a shallow, light touch these days
2013-10-02 13:17:19	Wraithan	i am very used to only pressing keys a bit past half way down
2013-10-02 13:17:22	s5fs	i blame chiclet keyboards
2013-10-02 13:17:28	s5fs	right, dancing across the keys
2013-10-02 13:17:54	adamdicarlo	never had a problem with the ball joint, but the goddamn circuitry fucks up in these boards eventually, and then keying the "x" or "z" key spits out "3xkf"
2013-10-02 13:18:05	s5fs	haha
2013-10-02 13:18:09	s5fs	everything dies eventually
2013-10-02 13:18:10	adamdicarlo	some four characters of gibberish ... for all the chars on certain rows
2013-10-02 13:18:11	Wraithan	Using laptop and other keyboards that require you to press them fully down leave me with pain in my hands
2013-10-02 13:18:12	adamdicarlo	yeah
2013-10-02 13:18:32	s5fs	i mean, i got a tattoo on my elbow and a good part of it wore off
2013-10-02 13:18:35	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: if you end up wanting to replace some of the circuitry, I highly recommend playing with the teensy
2013-10-02 13:18:50	s5fs	i'm not going to quit on elbows because of it
2013-10-02 13:19:16	Wraithan	I know a few people who have built keyboards using the teensy
2013-10-02 13:19:24	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, thanks for the recommendation... evernoting that. someday i probably will need to, when ebay runs out of the old model :)
2013-10-02 13:19:57	adamdicarlo	maybe i can build a hybrid board with key actuation up to Wraithan's standards but with the spread/lift of goldtouch...
2013-10-02 13:20:23	adamdicarlo	cuz I'm guessing I'd like lighter actuation too.
2013-10-02 13:20:25	Wraithan	:)
2013-10-02 13:21:19	Wraithan	heh, I'm a snob when it comes to that sort of stuff
2013-10-02 13:28:44	adamdicarlo	I don't blame you!

2013-10-02 15:18:33	Wraithan	hackygolucky_, s5fs: what ended up happening with the hardware kits that were built specifically for nodebots day?
2013-10-02 15:18:50	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: pdxnode still has 'em.
2013-10-02 15:19:03	hackygolucky_	'pdxnode' == sitting in my desk here at work.
2013-10-02 15:19:27	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: so, supposing I had a really great project, that isn't really node related other than dotc, would I be able to get my hands on one of those for a while
2013-10-02 15:19:32	Wraithan	mostly I need an arduino
2013-10-02 15:19:43	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-10-02 15:20:27	Wraithan	I want to take dotc, and built a waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better build and etc system for arduino and other hobbyist electronics
2013-10-02 15:21:13	hackygolucky_	very cool.
2013-10-02 15:21:14	Wraithan	After thinking about it a lot, I am pretty sure I can do this really well and make a product and such that is solid enough to really be MY project
2013-10-02 15:23:16	hackygolucky_	hrm. Will write that down as a project. Library for hardware
2013-10-02 15:23:40	Wraithan	Make build system, documentation, modules, and generally the experience of working with lower level hardware better
2013-10-02 15:25:09	Wraithan	Leveraging systems and skills I already have of course, like RTD, dotc, etc

2013-10-03 13:28:46	hackygolucky_	thoward: I took minutes and I'll post it all in the pdxnode repo.
2013-10-03 13:29:05	hackygolucky_	I've got a flight to catch in a few hours and I'll do that on the plane.
2013-10-03 13:29:22	thoward	sounds good to me.
2013-10-03 13:29:36	nvcexploder	my favorite so far is that chrisdickinson and I want to do a Workshop Workshop,
2013-10-03 13:29:48	nvcexploder	and I want the first step to be

2013-10-03 13:30:29	nvcexploder	have you got a bear suit?
2013-10-03 13:30:38	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-10-03 13:31:08	thoward	some things i wanted to bring up: merging the pdxnode/nodepdx monikers. it's silly to have them be separate and causes weird confusion.
2013-10-03 13:31:23	chrisdickinson	"imagine my embarrassment, showing up to ben's house in a suit made for bears, when all he wanted was for us to dress up *as* bears."
2013-10-03 13:32:27	thoward	i have some weird plans for nodepdx 2014, which i wanted to discuss in detail. also, this related to cascadiajs organizing for 2014, as it will be in pdx.
2013-10-03 13:33:39	thoward	carter and i have been talking about going a massive "js week", involving both a nodepdx conf, a cascadiajs conf, and a bunch of other activities.
2013-10-03 13:34:15	hackygolucky_	thoward: that occurred to me today when we were talking about the conference and me setting up a pdxnode bank account
2013-10-03 13:34:27	s5fs	chrisdickinson: still better than bear suet
2013-10-03 13:34:37	hackygolucky_	wut. cascadiajs in pdx? WIN
2013-10-03 13:34:38	thoward	i also want to change the funding model of the conf, and need some help with that plan.
2013-10-03 13:35:12	hackygolucky_	dude. We need to have a State of Node in pdx offsite.
2013-10-03 13:35:13	Maciek416	you should have a day called NaN Day
2013-10-03 13:35:18	hackygolucky_	that isn't the bbq. hrm.
2013-10-03 13:35:28	hackygolucky_	thoward: that's a bunch of really good ideas.
2013-10-03 13:36:01	s5fs	thoward: thoward two confs in a single week?
2013-10-03 13:36:03	thoward	setting up a bank account is a PIA, but worth it once you have it. i'm always willing to help w/ the one i have for various confs. right now the only thing it's used for is nodepdx/jsconf.cn
2013-10-03 13:36:41	thoward	s5fs: or one bigggggaaassszzzzz conf, depending on how you look at it
2013-10-03 13:36:51	hackygolucky_	thoward: right. I think a separation of concerns/dollars is fine.
2013-10-03 13:36:59	hackygolucky_	Makes for easier bookkeeping, imho.
2013-10-03 13:36:59	s5fs	thoward: better to pitch it as one big conf
2013-10-03 13:37:11	nvcexploder	chrisdickinson: either suit is fine.
2013-10-03 13:37:13	s5fs	otherwise two smaller confs will be competing for eyes
2013-10-03 13:37:23	chrisdickinson	nvcexploder: one has a pocket for honeycombs!
2013-10-03 13:38:02	thoward	also, it's a personal goal to pass on nodepdx organizer role by 2015.
2013-10-03 13:38:05	nvcexploder	AND I HAVE HONEYCOMBS!!!!!!

2013-10-03 13:39:18	thoward	i feel like it should be run by this group, and want to hand it over.

2013-10-03 13:41:02	s5fs	hackygolucky_: may I PM?
2013-10-03 13:41:14	s5fs	thoward: right, we need a node-centric Adron, basically
2013-10-03 13:41:26	hackygolucky_	s5fs: sure
2013-10-03 13:42:24	thoward	both of those guys were too busy last year to really help much. one of the reasons i want to hand this off is that i'm tired of having so much input on it. i feel like it needs a more diverse set of inputs, and the folks that i've been working with haven't had enough time to do that, so it's ended up being 99% me, which is way too much.
2013-10-03 13:43:07	s5fs	thoward: frankly the amt of work you put in to it scares me, haha!
2013-10-03 13:43:08	thoward	i don't mind the workload, but i do mind the narrow perspective that a dominant organizer brings to an event.
2013-10-03 13:44:01	nvcexploder	thoward: do you want complete handoff, or just more people sharing vision?
2013-10-03 13:44:16	nvcexploder	(let it be known that I feel dirty for using the word 'vision)
2013-10-03 13:44:30	thoward	nvcexploder: i want 2014 to see me take a non-dominant role, and by 2015, we'll see how i feel then.
2013-10-03 13:44:33	nvcexploder	(but not dirty for asking people to dress up as bears. or ewoks)

2013-10-03 13:45:49	Wraithan	I'll read backscroll in a bit
2013-10-03 13:45:52	 *	Wraithan goes off to lunch
2013-10-03 13:45:59	thoward	part of that is also that i really want to focus on writethedocs (expanding to eu), and on bringing jsconf.cn to independence as well.

2013-10-03 13:46:39	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work Wraithan!
2013-10-03 13:48:23	chrisdickinson	ah, for folks that want things on the website: https://github.com/PDXNode/pdxnode/issues/22
2013-10-03 13:49:21	hackygolucky_	thoward: as if it is a big surprise, I'm happy to help with nodepdx
2013-10-03 13:51:24	thoward	hackygolucky_: i was hoping that was the case! i think the pdxnode organizing team is a good balance of perspectives and talents, and that you all have a wonderful attitude toward organizing and community. i think nodepdx will be better off with you all running it.
2013-10-03 13:52:20	s5fs	thoward: i'm also happy to help with pdxnode
2013-10-03 13:53:06	hackygolucky_	thoward: if you'd like we can see who in pdxnode organizers would like to take a role in helping nodepdx and treat that as a big training for us running it.
2013-10-03 13:53:25	hackygolucky_	nodepdx2013, specifically, I mean.
2013-10-03 13:53:29	thoward	i was thinking that we could start focusing on a plan for nodepdx 2014 after i come back from jingjs/cascadiajs, in late nov or early dec.
2013-10-03 13:54:29	hackygolucky_	oh wait
2013-10-03 13:54:30	hackygolucky_	yeah
2013-10-03 13:54:36	thoward	one of my goals is to upturn the funding model. i really dislike the sponsorship/ticketing/budgeting model that most conferences employ (and that i've also been employing)
2013-10-03 13:54:38	hackygolucky_	2014 is the next one.
2013-10-03 13:54:43	thoward	lolol..
2013-10-03 13:54:47	 *	hackygolucky_ is feeling a little rundown.
2013-10-03 13:54:47	thoward	i do that all the time.
2013-10-03 13:55:10	thoward	i don't like hidden budgets.
2013-10-03 13:55:28	thoward	i like transparency.
2013-10-03 13:55:37	hackygolucky_	thoward: sounds like a good plan(starting after jingjs) and a different funding model would be suuuuper sweet.
2013-10-03 13:56:07	hackygolucky_	doesn't gothamjs do something like that?
2013-10-03 13:56:59	hackygolucky_	oops
2013-10-03 13:57:00	hackygolucky_	empirejs
2013-10-03 13:57:05	hackygolucky_	two different things.
2013-10-03 13:57:14	hackygolucky_	whatever charlie worked on
2013-10-03 13:57:24	thoward	so i kind of want to do funding in a fashion similar to kickstarter/indiegogo, where all the conference costs are posted, and folks can contribute as much as they want to any specific thing, or put money in a general pool to apply to all costs. the amount can be variable. it can be a large many-thousands sponsorship, or a small $20 donation. various levels of funding get you various rewards, including things like, tickets to attend, t-shirts, logos o
2013-10-03 13:58:20	thoward	hackygolucky_: not sure about empirejs. i thought that was done in typical manner.
2013-10-03 13:58:56	hackygolucky_	maybe. I think indexzero had a good post about running it, however.
2013-10-03 13:59:12	hackygolucky_	http://sudomakethought.com/00-empirejs-by-the-numbers

2013-10-03 13:59:36	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-10-03 14:00:36	dlmanning	week.js
2013-10-03 14:03:51	thoward	the biggest difference is allowing folks to contribute as much or as little as they want via a open crowd-funded model. i'm tired of telling sponsors "give $3k, trust me it's worth it" vs telling attendees "give me $50, it's cheap"... well $50 might not be cheap to some people, and it might be like crazy-cheap to others. some attendees might pay $200 or $15, and i think thats reasonable. pay what you can afford/think it's worth to you. same w/ sponso
2013-10-03 14:05:03	thoward	i'm also tired of back-channel style requests for sponsorship. i want them to go to a website, swipe a credit card, and be involved because they want to be, not because i berated them in email.
2013-10-03 14:05:06	s5fs	thoward: what about the free rider effect?
2013-10-03 14:05:15	thoward	s5fs: i'm completely ok with that.
2013-10-03 14:05:44	thoward	sf5: but if the conf doesn't get funded... it doesn't happen.
2013-10-03 14:06:01	s5fs	right
2013-10-03 14:06:09	thoward	i've lost money every year i've run nodepdx
2013-10-03 14:06:28	thoward	that's very frustrating, considering how much money i handle.
2013-10-03 14:06:46	thoward	part of that is poor accounting on my part, because i'm over worked.
2013-10-03 14:06:46	s5fs	yeah that's not good
2013-10-03 14:07:16	thoward	i haven't lost *a lot* of money.. less than $1k a year.
2013-10-03 14:07:22	s5fs	i think a good goal for 2014 is "thoward ride free"
2013-10-03 14:07:35	dlmanning	thoward: $50 was uber cheap for the conference last year
2013-10-03 14:07:46	chrisdickinson	o/ i am also belatedly happy to help with nodepdx :)
2013-10-03 14:07:47	thoward	s5fs: lol, yeah.
2013-10-03 14:08:16	s5fs	thoward: okay so with yoyu and three organizers, we each will lose less than $250/yr, progress!
2013-10-03 14:08:39	thoward	s5fs: hahaha now you know my grand scheme -- to make other people lose money! :)
2013-10-03 14:09:23	s5fs	thoward: also, never put a year on a shirt, then we can reuse forever!
2013-10-03 14:09:31	dlmanning	thoward: You know it's not morally reprehensible for you to make a little money for all the work you put into the conference, right?
2013-10-03 14:09:37	hackygolucky_	s5fs: nice.
2013-10-03 14:09:54	s5fs	thoward: also, if we have a bit of lead time i can try to get rid of excess food as well.
2013-10-03 14:09:55	thoward	nah i want a web app to manage this shit for me, and to do the accounting. or better yet, hire an accountant to help with the conf. they don't cost that much, and it would take a huge load off my mind... which i could use to focus on creating better content, etc.
2013-10-03 14:10:05	hackygolucky_	yeah, I'm not cool with the notion of a conf losing money. nodepdx was rad and super cheap
2013-10-03 14:10:18	thoward	s5fs: i learned that the hard way with nodepdx 2012.
2013-10-03 14:10:23	s5fs	thoward: i can find an accountant or do the books myself
2013-10-03 14:10:24	thoward	notice that nodepdx 2013 didn't have years.
2013-10-03 14:10:35	s5fs	thoward: indeed i did!
2013-10-03 14:10:41	hackygolucky_	it was an awesome design.
2013-10-03 14:10:50	thoward	i think hiring a proper accountant is a good first step.
2013-10-03 14:11:06	hackygolucky_	is that really necessary?
2013-10-03 14:11:14	hackygolucky_	I'm a spreadsheet fiend.
2013-10-03 14:11:26	thoward	hackygolucky_: thanks! that part (designing stuff) is a lot of fun.
2013-10-03 14:11:52	s5fs	my buddy is an accountant with a masters degree, i'll see if he wants to do it for free
2013-10-03 14:12:12	thoward	hackygolucky_: i think it is. i'm pretty good at managing a budget too, but separation of concerns, FTW
2013-10-03 14:12:13	s5fs	as long as it's not his busy season and we are pretty easy going it may work out
2013-10-03 14:12:39	s5fs	thoward: you need a board of directors, treasurer, etc
2013-10-03 14:12:50	thoward	thoward: and a yacht
2013-10-03 14:13:03	thoward	(yeah that was a note-to-self)
2013-10-03 14:13:05	hackygolucky_	yup yup
2013-10-03 14:14:19	s5fs	okay i'm going back to work haha
2013-10-03 14:14:21	thoward	anyhow -- we can dive into this in depth post-cascadiajs, over left-over turkey
2013-10-03 14:14:42	s5fs	sounds good, i'll be free all of nov/dec execept for real work. i'm not traveling anywhere afaik.
2013-10-03 14:14:52	s5fs	i'd like to organize at least one small hardware hack day before the EOY
2013-10-03 14:15:02	thoward	i'm starting a new job on nov 1
2013-10-03 14:15:12	s5fs	thoward: may I PM?
2013-10-03 14:15:25	thoward	s5fs: always

2013-10-03 14:16:26	thoward	i do love me some 3am tacos
2013-10-03 14:16:55	s5fs	thoward: yeah but i had burritos that night and didn't reply haha!

2013-10-03 14:58:00	chrisdickinson	and that's why you don't see any otters utilizing any of the simple machines
2013-10-03 14:58:08	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-10-03 14:58:22	Wraithan	you ran up the stairs then started punching the thing on your chair

2013-10-03 15:35:38	thoward	hopefully they will get this worked out soon. they keep saying "we've fixed it", but it's still janky.
2013-10-03 15:40:07	dlmanning	thoward: So I created a new page for one of my random projects and it appeared instantly
2013-10-03 15:40:26	dlmanning	But I'm still waiting for one for PCS to appear
2013-10-03 15:40:29	dlmanning	Frustrating
2013-10-03 15:45:10	dlmanning	Okay, as stupid as this sounds. It appears to want the repo name to be all lowercase
2013-10-03 15:45:51	dlmanning	lowercase repo names have their pages appear instantly, Mixed case names won't appear
2013-10-03 15:46:17	JSON_voorhees	dlmanning: that is weirdddd
2013-10-03 15:46:34	thoward	dlmanning: casing is important, but i think the randomness of processing is more to do with where your job get stuck in the queue.
2013-10-03 15:46:56	dlmanning	thoward: Maybe, but this is consistent behavior so far
2013-10-03 15:46:59	thoward	and case is significant for github, in general. i've been bit by that a number of times with cased usernames, etc.
2013-10-03 15:47:54	thoward	coudl be that something in the routing layer is normalizing things to lower case, and thus can't resolve to mixed case.
2013-10-03 15:48:19	dlmanning	Actually, just produced a counter-example
2013-10-03 15:48:42	thoward	i've seen that behaviour in intermediate routers, where they normalized case of headers, for example. that can break a ton of shit.
2013-10-03 15:48:54	dlmanning	My new theory is that it just didn't like that particular repo
2013-10-03 15:49:09	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: make absolutely sure it doesn't have git submodules
2013-10-03 15:49:16	chrisdickinson	or another .git file committed to it
2013-10-03 15:49:27	thoward	that's been my going theory too. i've got various ghpages projects. some of them are faster than others. some are seriously slow (like an hour or more)
2013-10-03 15:49:34	chrisdickinson	it will flip the table so hard
2013-10-03 15:49:38	thoward	some are spotty.. like partial updates, which really sucks.
2013-10-03 15:49:57	chrisdickinson	i once pushed to a subproject of mine and it had a `.git` committed inside of it, and it brought down *all* of my github pages
2013-10-03 15:50:02	chrisdickinson	for every project i had
2013-10-03 15:50:07	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: lol
2013-10-03 15:50:16	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: That does not appear to be the case
2013-10-03 15:50:41	dlmanning	Anyway, I just recreated the damned repo, and I appear to be acceptable to the github gremlins now

2013-10-04 13:23:43	chrisdickinson	ericholscher: use beefy
2013-10-04 13:24:06	chrisdickinson	basically, set your STATIC_URL to point at a beefy server running on another port
2013-10-04 13:25:23	ericholscher	in prod?

2013-10-07 12:18:38	ericholscher	:)
2013-10-07 12:20:05	chrisdickinson	ericholscher: anything in particular, this time around?
2013-10-07 12:20:29	ericholscher	tbh I haven't had to look at the docs at all after I got it setup, its pretty simple
2013-10-07 12:20:36	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-10-07 12:20:42	ericholscher	I think it just needs a "wtf is this" section
2013-10-07 12:20:45	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-10-07 12:21:00	chrisdickinson	it doesn't really put its best foot forward
2013-10-07 12:21:13	ericholscher	but the whole require-based thing lets you sanely architect things, which is really valuable
2013-10-07 12:21:24	chrisdickinson	+1
2013-10-07 12:21:30	chrisdickinson	(+1e6)
2013-10-07 12:21:32	ericholscher	i haven't really picked up the nodeisms, but that alone was worth it
2013-10-07 12:22:06	chrisdickinson	the other upside is that if you need a module to do a thing you can go to `npm.im` and search for it
2013-10-07 12:22:12	chrisdickinson	so you can actually reuse JS code
2013-10-07 12:22:36	ericholscher	heh :)
2013-10-07 12:22:46	ericholscher	i haven't gotten that far, but its a neat idea
2013-10-07 12:22:54	ericholscher	i imagine there's a bunch of modules that could be useful that I just don't know about
2013-10-07 12:28:07	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: ejs makes me twitchy
2013-10-07 12:30:32	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I'm not sure I understand the DOM-aware vs. non-DOM-aware distinction with regard to templating languages
2013-10-07 12:31:13	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: basically, "does it operate on a DOM" or "does it operate by interpolating values into a string which happens to be HTML"
2013-10-07 12:31:17	Wraithan	ericholscher: when browserifying the type of module i use the most from npm are shims, so my code works across more browsers
2013-10-07 12:31:32	chrisdickinson	ericholscher: if you want websockets see `shoe`
2013-10-07 12:32:31	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: so plates and hyperstream operate by saying "here's the html i'm going to use as a base, give me a map of incoming data to selectors where i should put that data" (roughly)
2013-10-07 12:32:31	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: So any template system that has a browser runtime would be DOM aware?
2013-10-07 12:32:37	chrisdickinson	not quite
2013-10-07 12:32:59	chrisdickinson	so, hyperstream is dom-aware but runs in node
2013-10-07 12:33:16	dlmanning	Because it uses CSS selectors?
2013-10-07 12:33:21	chrisdickinson	but does so by turning the html string it starts with into a full DOM tree structure, and then modifies that tree structure using selectors
2013-10-07 12:33:22	chrisdickinson	yes
2013-10-07 12:33:33	chrisdickinson	most traditional non-dom-aware template languages don't do this
2013-10-07 12:34:10	dlmanning	How is ejs dom-aware, then?
2013-10-07 12:34:13	chrisdickinson	it's not
2013-10-07 12:34:16	dlmanning	okay
2013-10-07 12:34:47	chrisdickinson	ejs, handlebars, mustache, hogan, and plate (my plate) are not dom aware
2013-10-07 12:35:02	dlmanning	Nor is jade
2013-10-07 12:35:32	chrisdickinson	yeah -- it happens to create a tree structure, but that tree structure doesn't *necessarily* have anything to do with HTML / a DOM
2013-10-07 12:35:37	dlmanning	It has a layout and block insertion system, but it isn't working with a dom
2013-10-07 12:35:44	chrisdickinson	right
2013-10-07 12:35:52	dlmanning	okay
2013-10-07 12:36:09	dlmanning	So what my working methodologies are not dom aware
2013-10-07 12:36:20	dlmanning	s/what//
2013-10-07 12:36:41	chrisdickinson	that's totally cool. it's probably more standard to be dom-unaware
2013-10-07 12:37:00	dlmanning	I take a bunch of precompiled jade templates which are just javascript functions that generate html strings
2013-10-07 12:37:03	chrisdickinson	though being dom-aware can ensure some pretty neat things -- like, it's impossible to produce gibberish html
2013-10-07 12:37:33	dlmanning	yeah, that's cool
2013-10-07 12:37:43	chrisdickinson	or you can swap out whatever engine you're using to give yourself a dom with another one (hyperstream swapping out trumpet for the real dom in browser)
2013-10-07 12:38:06	dlmanning	Sounds a little heavier to work with though

2013-10-07 12:39:00	chrisdickinson	and in domtemplate's case, it requires a full jsdom environment to run anywhere but the browser it seems
2013-10-07 12:39:31	dlmanning	right
2013-10-07 12:39:35	chrisdickinson	and logic can be weird because it's tied to elements

2013-10-07 14:47:35	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: do you know of any instances of DOM aware templates (apart from domtemplate) which implement variables like mustache/django?
2013-10-07 14:47:51	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: I like when there's something that says "this is the moving part"
2013-10-07 14:48:39	chrisdickinson	AWinterman: -ish, iirc, angular/ember do this. but it gets weird.
2013-10-07 14:48:56	AWinterman	angular/ember get weird? Or that idea does
2013-10-07 14:49:09	chrisdickinson	because that `{{ hey guys i'm a variable }}` thing by its very nature treats HTML as a string
2013-10-07 14:49:36	chrisdickinson	because to insert a variable you're inserting a string containing "{{ hey guys i'm a variable }}" into another string (that happens to be html)
2013-10-07 14:49:56	AWinterman	yeah, either that or requiring your parser to be aware of yet another langauge
2013-10-07 14:49:58	chrisdickinson	so `{{ hey guys… }}` represents a `text node`
2013-10-07 14:50:14	AWinterman	err, by language I might mean node type
2013-10-07 14:51:21	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: wouldn't the alternative be to design a parser which recognizes {{ .* }} as yet another node type?
2013-10-07 14:52:33	chrisdickinson	yes, with all of the error cases that involves :)
2013-10-07 14:53:02	chrisdickinson	<a href="{{ url }}"> vs <a {{url}}> vs <{{ tag }}> vs <a href="#">{{ text }}</a>
2013-10-07 14:53:25	AWinterman	oooo boy
2013-10-07 14:53:55	AWinterman	yeah, seems like you'd have to require it to be used like any other html tag
2013-10-07 14:53:57	chrisdickinson	and then position determines whether it's represented as a textnode or an attribute on a tag or...
2013-10-07 14:54:02	AWinterman	oh god
2013-10-07 14:54:03	AWinterman	nested tags
2013-10-07 14:54:06	AWinterman	:X
2013-10-07 14:54:07	chrisdickinson	and if it turns into a textnode...
2013-10-07 14:54:13	chrisdickinson	how do you query for a textnode?
2013-10-07 14:54:19	chrisdickinson	(in jquery/querySelectorAll?)
2013-10-07 14:54:30	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: that seems like a zen of DOM question
2013-10-07 14:54:42	Wraithan	Very carefully
2013-10-07 14:54:45	chrisdickinson	iirc, it was one of (angular|ember) whose answer was "put in an empty script tag with a well known id"
2013-10-07 14:54:57	chrisdickinson	and an "end script tag" similarly
2013-10-07 14:56:55	AWinterman	I guess I'm actually looking for a template language that has signature render(template_string, context) -> DocumentFragment
2013-10-07 14:57:39	chrisdickinson	AWinterman: `plate.template.render(context, function(err, data) { return ready(err, err ? null : $(data)) })` ;)
2013-10-07 14:57:39	AWinterman	which is actually pretty unnecessary, given that you can just create an element, and then add some html to it with insertAdjacentHTML
2013-10-07 14:57:43	AWinterman	heh
2013-10-07 14:57:44	AWinterman	yeah
2013-10-07 14:57:45	AWinterman	or jquery
2013-10-07 14:57:47	AWinterman	or innerHTML
2013-10-07 14:58:36	chrisdickinson	a lot of the promise of databinding / meteor / et al is that they'll let you write "poke holes"-style templates / dom-unaware templates, but they'll keep track of where these items *are* in the dom for you
2013-10-07 14:58:49	chrisdickinson	and batch writes/updates of them at once
2013-10-07 14:59:16	chrisdickinson	some do this by tracking which are attributes and which are textnodes and which are hats, some do it by just wiping away the dom whenever necessary
2013-10-07 14:59:36	chrisdickinson	they all tend to batch (read: "use debounce to avoid thrashing the dom")
2013-10-07 15:00:40	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: hmm, I've kind of been rolling my own data-binding with npm.im/estate
2013-10-07 15:00:48	chrisdickinson	yep :)
2013-10-07 15:01:11	chrisdickinson	well, not "yep :)"
2013-10-07 15:01:12	chrisdickinson	but!
2013-10-07 15:01:15	chrisdickinson	cool!
2013-10-07 15:01:18	chrisdickinson	(that's what it's for)
2013-10-07 15:01:30	chrisdickinson	(and hopefully it is useful at being for that thing.)
2013-10-07 15:01:37	AWinterman	it is
2013-10-07 15:01:38	AWinterman	:)
2013-10-07 15:01:42	chrisdickinson	phew
2013-10-07 15:01:59	AWinterman	I had a brief spate of nerves yesterday over XSS via innerHTML
2013-10-07 15:02:05	chrisdickinson	oh yes
2013-10-07 15:02:35	AWinterman	but since I'm only ever innerHTML-ing strings sent directly from the server, I think it's probably pretty okay
2013-10-07 15:02:38	chrisdickinson	that's that thing I always harp on with "never construct HTML by concatenating strings and then dumping them into the DOM"
2013-10-07 15:03:11	AWinterman	ah, does jquery do input sanitization? I'm trying to get away with just using sizzle
2013-10-07 15:03:12	chrisdickinson	(i.e., `$('<div>' + user.username + '</div>').appendTo('body')`)
2013-10-07 15:03:21	chrisdickinson	(will ruin everything)
2013-10-07 15:03:23	AWinterman	hah
2013-10-07 15:03:47	chrisdickinson	or `$('body').html('<div>' + americas.funniest.home.videos + '</div>')` will similarly ruin the world
2013-10-07 15:06:42	AWinterman	hmm, I'm essentially doing `el.innerHTML = mustache.render('<div>{{me}}</div><div>{{you}}</div>', context)`
2013-10-07 15:07:48	AWinterman	which, to be honest, feels pretty similar
2013-10-07 15:09:51	chrisdickinson	AWinterman: mustache (and plate and django and really most template languages!) escape html outputs
2013-10-07 15:11:02	chrisdickinson	so, `el.innerHTML = mustache.render('<div>{{ me }}</div>', {me: '<script>alert("wow")</script>'})` would produce `<div>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;wow&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</div>`
2013-10-07 15:21:04	AWinterman	chrisdickinson: oh, good point. The mustache source is litered with "escape":
2013-10-07 15:21:17	AWinterman	also that just happens :)

2013-10-08 12:57:36	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: What version of node are you working on locally?
2013-10-08 12:57:45	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: 10.18
2013-10-08 12:58:05	dlmanning	Have you tried beefy's live reload thingy on it?
2013-10-08 12:58:17	chrisdickinson	yes, i was having some intermittent issues!
2013-10-08 12:58:35	chrisdickinson	but then i tried again and it worked, so i thought maybe i had gone momentarily insane.
2013-10-08 12:58:51	dlmanning	it works the first time
2013-10-08 12:58:56	dlmanning	And then it doesn't
2013-10-08 12:59:49	dlmanning	At least that's how it was behaving for me
2013-10-08 12:59:54	chrisdickinson	hmm
2013-10-08 12:59:57	chrisdickinson	beefy version is latest?
2013-10-08 13:00:03	dlmanning	I went back to 0.10.17 and it's fine
2013-10-08 13:00:05	dlmanning	yup
2013-10-08 13:00:06	chrisdickinson	:|
2013-10-08 13:00:15	dlmanning	It's the same bug I was seeing with testem
2013-10-08 13:00:18	chrisdickinson	and you're on 0.10.18 as well?
2013-10-08 13:00:28	dlmanning	0.10.20, actually
2013-10-08 13:00:31	chrisdickinson	hm
2013-10-08 13:00:50	chrisdickinson	could you open an issue on the beefy tracker?
2013-10-08 13:00:50	dlmanning	But it's the same with all the versions since 0.10.18
2013-10-08 13:00:57	dlmanning	It's not a beefy issue
2013-10-08 13:01:00	dlmanning	It's libuv
2013-10-08 13:01:12	chrisdickinson	hmmm
2013-10-08 13:01:29	dlmanning	Remember when I was going on about FileEvent being broken?

2013-10-08 13:57:58	drueck	I have one but I never write things. :/
2013-10-08 14:00:02	hackygolucky_	drueck: same here.
2013-10-08 14:00:09	hackygolucky_	I have notes on about 5 posts I should have written
2013-10-08 14:00:23	hackygolucky_	I was going to turn my -one- conference talk into a long form as well.
2013-10-08 14:00:39	hackygolucky_	oh the things I would do if I would stop making lists of lists and actually action them.
2013-10-08 14:02:21	drueck	hackygolucky_: Heheh... yeah, I know the feeling.
2013-10-08 14:02:53	drueck	I often think about changing the CMS my blog is using, writing my own, etc, but not often about actually posting things.
2013-10-08 14:03:05	drueck	It used to be hand-coded in php, and now it's Wordpress, which I don't really like.
2013-10-08 14:03:43	drueck	I thought about re-writing it in Rails or Sinatra a while back... now I wouldn't mind using a static site generator or that new Ghost blogging platform that's coming out...
2013-10-08 14:04:04	drueck	OR... I could actually write posts!
2013-10-08 14:04:05	drueck	;)
2013-10-08 14:05:20	hackygolucky_	I'm SUPER excited about Ghost
2013-10-08 14:05:36	drueck	The website is really nice. It does look pretty cool.
2013-10-08 14:05:39	hackygolucky_	I signed up for the developer invite for when they open source it
2013-10-08 14:05:53	hackygolucky_	even if it isn't a style I agree with, I can't wait to mess with it.
2013-10-08 14:06:05	 *	drueck goes to do that now!
2013-10-08 14:07:34	drueck	I haven't really looked into it much, just heard about it on a podcast and it sounded cool.
2013-10-08 14:08:03	drueck	What I'm looking for is a platform that's good at blogging but also good at organizing/viewing photos in a particular way.
2013-10-08 14:08:32	drueck	So, if I adopted it, I'd have to add my own slideshow plugin type thing, which would actually be pretty fun using node and javascript front end stuff.

2013-10-08 14:22:59	drueck	blogs
2013-10-08 14:23:01	dlmanning	I had one once, but it kinda devolved into this: http://cmeconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/old-man-cloud.jpg
2013-10-08 14:23:30	drueck	haha
2013-10-08 14:25:43	drueck	My blog is mostly about hiking/backpacking/traveling. I haven't gotten into writing about technical stuff yet. I should.
2013-10-08 14:26:51	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-10-08 14:30:44	dlmanning	As for static site generators, I'm a little infatuated with harp this week: http://harpjs.com/
2013-10-08 14:31:28	hackygolucky_	ah yes!
2013-10-08 14:31:31	hackygolucky_	forgot about that.
2013-10-08 14:32:31	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: are your students going to mess with it at all?
2013-10-08 14:35:26	drueck	I'll have to check that out. I use Jekyll a bit at work for our internal docs. I like it ok, except that the requirement of having dates for every post is very irrelevant for what I'm using it for.

2013-10-08 14:54:00	hackygolucky_	I mean, it IS another tool. Newbs don't need choices.
2013-10-08 14:54:05	hackygolucky_	mmhmm.
2013-10-08 14:54:30	dlmanning	There are soooo many categories of things

2013-10-08 15:38:18	chrisdickinson	git's a hard concept to fully grasp when you're first getting started out but it's invaluable as a conceptual "safety net"
2013-10-08 15:39:16	hackygolucky_	git being introduced at the same time as command line is what got me.
2013-10-08 15:39:56	hackygolucky_	it was just a bunch of stuff I'm typing in terminal, what's the difference?
2013-10-08 15:40:02	hackygolucky_	=== former me.
2013-10-08 15:42:35	chrisdickinson	i programmed for 3-4 years without version control :\
2013-10-08 15:43:03	chrisdickinson	consequently, i wasted an enormous amount of time without really being aware of it (whoops!)
2013-10-08 15:45:30	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Does window.location = window.location not trigger a page reload when there's a hash link?
2013-10-08 15:45:41	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: good question!
2013-10-08 15:46:05	dlmanning	According to unnamed sources (me), the answer is: no :)

2013-10-09 12:55:18	hackygolucky_	so I'm sure you seasoned nodesters already have a preferred method, -BUT-

2013-10-09 12:55:38	hackygolucky_	I appreciate Joyent providing a number of well-worn paths for installation.
2013-10-09 12:55:41	hackygolucky_	:D
2013-10-09 12:57:45	Wraithan	brew install node
2013-10-09 12:58:57	chrisdickinson	download package installer
2013-10-09 12:58:59	chrisdickinson	install
2013-10-09 12:59:04	chrisdickinson	npm install -g nave
2013-10-09 12:59:15	Wraithan	i haven't gotten around to using nave
2013-10-09 12:59:18	chrisdickinson	(at least, that's how i roll)
2013-10-09 12:59:22	chrisdickinson	i don't often use nave directly
2013-10-09 12:59:31	chrisdickinson	but i have it around for when i need to test different versions
2013-10-09 12:59:57	chrisdickinson	i've avoided brew because it has had issues in the past with node/npm
2013-10-09 13:00:08	Wraithan	ah
2013-10-09 13:00:13	Wraithan	it appears to be fine right now

2013-10-09 13:03:27	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: I think isaacs specifically recommends -not- using homebrew
2013-10-09 13:03:54	Wraithan	if he has a good reason, I'd be interested, I'd be even more interested in a bug report against homebrew
2013-10-09 13:04:27	chrisdickinson	i think it had to do with expectations homebrew had that conflicted with how node/npm see the world
2013-10-09 13:06:27	chrisdickinson	https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/3762 documents it, i think
2013-10-09 13:08:31	Wraithan	3 years old, comes from before npm was packaged with homebrew, basically irrelevent
2013-10-09 13:08:48	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-10-09 13:09:03	Wraithan	no offense
2013-10-09 13:09:52	chrisdickinson	so, i typically advocate the package installer route to newbies / folks i don't know because it's a known quantity and doesn't require the installation of another tool/package manager
2013-10-09 13:09:54	Wraithan	https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/13024 more recent
2013-10-09 13:10:05	chrisdickinson	i have no great qualms with you using homebrew
2013-10-09 13:10:16	Wraithan	and they came to an understanding, part of the problem was homebrew misunderstanding
2013-10-09 13:10:29	Wraithan	they updated recipes and fixed the problems
2013-10-09 13:11:02	chrisdickinson	yep
2013-10-09 13:11:23	Wraithan	I can totally see advocating the installer method for folks who don't have brew and wont expect to need to install stuff from it
2013-10-09 13:11:42	Wraithan	but I hate installing anything without a package manager

2013-10-11 11:27:57	s5fs	hi everyone
2013-10-11 11:30:45	dlmanning	'sup
2013-10-11 11:30:57	s5fs	coffee'in
2013-10-11 11:31:11	s5fs	apparently 11a is the new 9a
2013-10-11 11:32:20	dlmanning	hah
2013-10-11 11:32:20	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-10-11 11:32:32	dlmanning	missed you guys last night
2013-10-11 11:33:43	hackygolucky_	we missed you!
2013-10-11 11:33:49	hackygolucky_	how was class, dlmanning ?
2013-10-11 11:34:00	dlmanning	good. I think
2013-10-11 11:34:23	dlmanning	a nice progression from "wft" to "oh, we kinda get that"
2013-10-11 11:34:49	s5fs	dlmanning: awesome, that's progress
2013-10-11 11:35:09	s5fs	dlmanning: what's the general skill level of the class? any prior programming experience?
2013-10-11 11:35:29	dlmanning	It varies rather a lot
2013-10-11 11:35:54	dlmanning	A few folks have some general experience hacking on things
2013-10-11 11:36:15	dlmanning	Some people have never opened the terminal window before
2013-10-11 11:36:48	dlmanning	I have been asked to explain the difference between a file and a directory
2013-10-11 11:36:52	s5fs	i figured cli experience would be light
2013-10-11 11:37:07	s5fs	fasciating
2013-10-11 11:37:46	s5fs	dlmanning: hearing about your students makes me appreciate your role even more
2013-10-11 11:37:46	dlmanning	I think some people didn't get off the bat that the stuff in the terminal was the same filesystem you could see in Finder
2013-10-11 11:38:05	dlmanning	They're really good people though. Lots of enthusiasm for the most part
2013-10-11 11:38:17	s5fs	that's good
2013-10-11 11:39:27	dlmanning	I just gave them their third assignment
2013-10-11 11:39:32	dlmanning	https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/JS2013F-assignment3
2013-10-11 11:39:38	dlmanning	If anyone's curious
2013-10-11 11:41:11	hackygolucky_	oooh
2013-10-11 11:41:12	hackygolucky_	nice.
2013-10-11 11:41:32	hackygolucky_	navigating the command line is interesting to wrap your head around as a newb.
2013-10-11 11:41:44	hackygolucky_	and by interesting, I mean really confusing.
2013-10-11 11:42:14	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i think that's more true for the younger crowd. it cut my teeth on ms-dos, the cli has always been there
2013-10-11 11:42:34	dlmanning	yeah. I was surprised by the command-line phobia. In retrospect it seems obvious
2013-10-11 11:42:35	hackygolucky_	s5fs: so, I had to navigate DOS when I was a wee one
2013-10-11 11:42:43	hackygolucky_	but got clear of it as I grew
2013-10-11 11:42:52	s5fs	its difficult to remember what it was like in the very beginning, i have trouble training really new folks because i don't know what they don't know.
2013-10-11 11:43:14	hackygolucky_	this was me not very long ago. It is still sharp enough in my mind to give me flashbacks.
2013-10-11 11:43:18	s5fs	hackygolucky_: yeah, we all did. but i think early exposure to the "guts" makes the cli less fearful
2013-10-11 11:43:31	hackygolucky_	hrm. not for me.
2013-10-11 11:43:39	chrisdickinson	it was always couched to me as a kid as the command line being somehow more "true" than the GUI
2013-10-11 11:43:40	hackygolucky_	I absolutely thought I'd break everything
2013-10-11 11:43:43	hackygolucky_	or delete it all.
2013-10-11 11:43:45	s5fs	like, i remember having to boot my machine, get dropped in dos and THEN start windows haha!
2013-10-11 11:44:09	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Yeah, I remember thinking Windows 95 was a lie because DOS was still underneath it
2013-10-11 11:44:21	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-10-11 11:44:52	s5fs	hackygolucky_: hm, thats actually a really good argument for virtual machines. if the fear is unrecoverable breakage on your main system then having a risk-free env to trash makes it less scary
2013-10-11 11:45:10	s5fs	possibly, anyways
2013-10-11 11:45:12	hackygolucky_	absolutely
2013-10-11 11:45:23	hackygolucky_	and then there's another concept you have to wrap your head around.
2013-10-11 11:45:23	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-10-11 11:45:29	hackygolucky_	a computer within a computer!
2013-10-11 11:45:41	hackygolucky_	insert keanu reeves blown away here.
2013-10-11 11:45:46	s5fs	i still struggle to explain VMs to regular folks
2013-10-11 11:46:03	dlmanning	http://xkcd.com/505/
2013-10-11 11:46:11	s5fs	i'm playing with docker, that's even harder to explain. i did a botch job trying to explain it to dlmanning not too long ago, haha!
2013-10-11 11:46:27	hackygolucky_	yeah I think justinabrahms has explained docker to me a couple of times
2013-10-11 11:46:39	hackygolucky_	I've never really paid enough attention to soak it in.
2013-10-11 11:47:04	justinabrahms	as best I understand it, docker is basically shell scripts where every action is a git commit that you can revert to.
2013-10-11 11:48:28	s5fs	justinabrahms: so that's how snapshots are managed?
2013-10-11 11:48:44	justinabrahms	snapshots get some sha-like thing. I know you can boot up a given sha-like thing.
2013-10-11 11:48:49	s5fs	justinabrahms: the runtime is an lxc, something else i don't yet know much about (aside from the basics of wikipedia)
2013-10-11 11:48:59	justinabrahms	this is my working understanding of it so far. It's possibly woefully wrong.
2013-10-11 11:49:03	dlmanning	s5fs: When you explained it to me I think I thought it was a hypervisor
2013-10-11 11:49:12	s5fs	dlmanning: yes, it kinda is
2013-10-11 11:49:28	s5fs	the kernel supports the creation of an LXC, which provides process isolation from other containers
2013-10-11 11:49:32	justinabrahms	hypervisor manages resources (I think) which docker doesn't do.
2013-10-11 11:49:43	s5fs	justinabrahms: the kernel manages resource allocation
2013-10-11 11:50:02	justinabrahms	What I mean is you cannot say "this docker piece gets 0.25 CPU"
2013-10-11 11:50:06	s5fs	so you're right, it's not a true hypervisor but the kernel does much of the work that a hv would normally do
2013-10-11 11:50:59	s5fs	justinabrahms: i'm not 100% but i believe you can manage resource allocation to a given lxc, which means you may be able to specify how much cpu a container gets
2013-10-11 11:51:10	s5fs	again, i dont know lxc well at all
2013-10-11 11:51:40	justinabrahms	I've talked with people more knowledgeable than me on the subject and they said this was the big reason you wouldn't use this over a VM
2013-10-11 11:51:56	justinabrahms	enforcement of making sure you don't starve other things.
2013-10-11 11:52:22	s5fs	ah, that's good info, thanks
2013-10-11 11:52:30	Wraithan	I was talking to some folks about how I'd never work for amazon... woke up with an amazon recruitment letter in my email
2013-10-11 11:52:41	justinabrahms	:)
2013-10-11 11:52:43	s5fs	Wraithan: haha!
2013-10-11 11:52:44	Wraithan	s5fs: thanks again for that ride down to the meetup
2013-10-11 11:53:04	dlmanning	Wraithan: So moving to Seattle then? :)
2013-10-11 11:53:49	Wraithan	honestly replied that their hostile stance towards their developers (releases just to work on open source and give talks and such) is abysmal, as well as having to move to seattle and having no remote workers
2013-10-11 11:54:32	s5fs	Wraithan: you're welcome, it was a fun chat :)
2013-10-11 11:54:45	s5fs	BYODD (bring your own door desk)
2013-10-11 11:56:40	s5fs	justinabrahms: okay so it looks like the way to manage resources on a container basis is to use cgroups. man, its like the more i dig into this, the less i know :D

2013-10-11 12:07:54	chrisdickinson	including my favorite sentence: "Hyper Needle Spray, Used by Medics to disperse poision"
2013-10-11 12:08:04	chrisdickinson	because 1. i couldn't bothered to spell poison correctly
2013-10-11 12:08:13	chrisdickinson	2. obviously medics disperse poison

2013-10-11 12:09:15	s5fs	chrisdickinson: typo, meant Poseidon
2013-10-11 12:09:30	chrisdickinson	"are you interested in some poseidon?"

2013-10-11 12:11:31	dlmanning	Need a way to force students to use semicolons
2013-10-11 12:11:57	s5fs	issue one demerit for each missing semicolon
2013-10-11 12:12:11	s5fs	those who use semicolons get a feather in their cap
2013-10-11 12:12:21	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: haha
2013-10-11 12:12:28	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: use jik :\
2013-10-11 12:12:55	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i found jik really interesting. i haven't spent any time learning the AST but totally need to.
2013-10-11 12:12:59	 *	chrisdickinson tries to think of the requisite selector
2013-10-11 12:13:21	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I want to use your linter, because irony
2013-10-11 12:13:24	s5fs	chrisdickinson: really interesting talk last night overall, i had a good time
2013-10-11 12:13:25	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-10-11 12:13:27	chrisdickinson	thanks!
2013-10-11 12:14:12	dlmanning	I told them they could stop using semicolons as soon as they were able to explain to me all the edge cases in which semicolons are necessary
2013-10-11 12:14:14	s5fs	my advice for speaking would be "never apologize" apologies show weakness and one day if you're presenting in front of a wolf-pack and you apologize, you may end up fighting for your life
2013-10-11 12:14:24	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: so i heard
2013-10-11 12:14:28	s5fs	also, continue training to bite the jugular
2013-10-11 12:14:44	dlmanning	:)
2013-10-11 12:15:01	s5fs	dlmanning: that's pretty clever
2013-10-11 12:15:19	chrisdickinson	s5fs: yeah, i need to practice public speaking. going to try and be conscious about my (copious) verbal static as well
2013-10-11 12:15:27	chrisdickinson	also! thanks for the advice.
2013-10-11 12:15:50	dlmanning	Never apologize to your wolf-pack. Got it
2013-10-11 12:16:18	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i also need to work on my public speaking
2013-10-11 12:16:33	s5fs	outside of the wolf thing i really have no idea
2013-10-11 12:17:44	chrisdickinson	"imagine the audience in their underwear, as wolves."
2013-10-11 12:18:31	s5fs	chrisdickinson: my biggest challenge is remembering to go slow
2013-10-11 12:18:39	dlmanning	... as long as doing so doesn't arouse you
2013-10-11 12:18:41	s5fs	i feel like i'm perpetually overclocked
2013-10-11 12:19:01	s5fs	dlmanning: depends on the topic, i'd say
2013-10-11 12:19:26	dlmanning	re: wolves in underwear ^

2013-10-13 17:35:33	s5fs	good to know, i'll take a look when it arrives and see if it has improved, or can be improved
2013-10-13 17:35:34	Wraithan	also you have the know how to solder it on better if there is an issue so it wouldn't be a problem for you lol
2013-10-13 17:36:48	s5fs	haha, only if it's out of warranty
2013-10-13 17:36:55	Wraithan	sure sure

2013-10-14 10:51:23	hackygolucky_	AWinterman: when they got a ton of funding they posted a number of positions available and a number of them were Ruby
2013-10-14 10:51:31	hackygolucky_	maybe that was more ops-y stuff?
2013-10-14 10:51:49	AWinterman	hackygolucky_: sounds reasonable to me
2013-10-14 10:52:04	dlmanning	They're using express
2013-10-14 10:54:57	AWinterman	and express can be coerced to sinnatra?

2013-10-14 10:58:13	dlmanning	express is a lot like sinatra

2013-10-14 11:38:08	nvcexploder	I have a question for folks:
2013-10-14 11:38:46	nvcexploder	would anybody be willing to get free food/coffee/hot chocolate to cheer on a small parade on Friday AM on 9th and Glisan?
2013-10-14 11:39:41	dlmanning	a small parade?
2013-10-14 11:39:48	nvcexploder	a small parade
2013-10-14 11:40:07	dlmanning	Are you taking your family into town, or?
2013-10-14 11:41:27	nvcexploder	we need folks yep
2013-10-14 11:41:46	nvcexploder	but it's not them I'm talking about -
2013-10-14 11:42:04	nvcexploder	we need folks to throw candy at a marching band + some folks marching behind them
2013-10-14 11:42:17	dlmanning	Oh, this is for RealtimeConf isn't it
2013-10-14 11:42:21	nvcexploder	yep
2013-10-14 11:42:22	nvcexploder	:)
2013-10-14 11:42:33	nvcexploder	any help is greatly appreciated
2013-10-14 11:42:38	dlmanning	Maybe
2013-10-14 11:43:17	dlmanning	I can do it (assuming always baby in not en route)
2013-10-14 11:43:35	nvcexploder	awesome! thanks!
2013-10-14 11:43:57	dlmanning	Can also ask and see if any PCS students have time
2013-10-14 11:46:46	nvcexploder	that would be rad
2013-10-14 11:47:01	nvcexploder	we're getting loads of donuts and coffee and hot chocolate
2013-10-14 11:47:10	nvcexploder	and candy to throw at people
2013-10-14 11:47:24	nvcexploder	which should be enough, IMO - throwing candy at Eran and Max and lots of other duders.
2013-10-14 11:48:39	dlmanning	I can even bring other things to throw
2013-10-14 11:48:58	dlmanning	I have at least one more cat than I need
2013-10-14 11:49:48	nvcexploder	and I one dog! let's see if we can combine them into a beast of nightmares.
2013-10-14 11:50:49	dlmanning	Like puppycat
2013-10-14 11:51:16	dlmanning	nvcexploder: Have you watched Bee and Puppycat?!? Because if you haven't. Stop whatever you're doing and go do it now
2013-10-14 11:51:30	dlmanning	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOG_UtLxh58
2013-10-14 12:03:14	s5fs	nvcexploder: hey, could I borrow a couple drones until end of the month?
2013-10-14 12:03:31	nvcexploder	dlmanning: looking now

2013-10-15 13:30:28	s5fs	what i like is that his talks are not only over my head, but they're also coming from a unique perspective
2013-10-15 13:30:35	hackygolucky_	yes!
2013-10-15 13:30:55	dlmanning	Some of the students might be down for nodeschool.io
2013-10-15 13:31:12	s5fs	internals guys are rarely as plain-spoken as forrest. even though i'm not able to make sense of the detail, i always feel like i'm getting the bigger picture.

2013-10-17 11:14:06	faddah	hey s5fs.  ;)
2013-10-17 11:14:30	faddah	folks, i'm sorry to beg off on yet another pdxnode meet-up, but i'll be volunteering at this, tonight & through the weekend =>  http://www.alljanenodick.com/ .  see all of you next meeting, maybe, if not in between?
2013-10-17 11:15:11	hackygolucky_	faddah: looks like fun!
2013-10-17 11:16:37	faddah	hackygolucky_ - yes, will be. tix still available and i really want to support this. want to combat the whole, nasty, ol' boys club thing in the industry about "women aren't funny" stupid snark
2013-10-17 11:17:21	faddah	hackygolucky_ - will post about that and another showcase i'll be in saturday in #pdxtech in a couple minutes.
2013-10-17 11:17:24	hackygolucky_	didn't realize that was a thing.
2013-10-17 11:17:32	faddah	uh, yeah. it is.

2013-10-17 11:18:07	faddah	big comics like adam carolla and such come out and say things like that, just to do a one-off snark, and it sticks.
2013-10-17 11:19:06	s5fs	yeah but adam carolla appeals to a certain demographic to begin with
2013-10-17 11:19:20	s5fs	socal contractors aren't exactly known for their progressive liberal thinking
2013-10-17 11:19:46	faddah	s5fs - true, but he has a bully pulpit that sets standards.
2013-10-17 11:20:30	hackygolucky_	humor is very subjective.
2013-10-17 11:20:33	jerrysv	tonight also starts realtime conf
2013-10-17 11:21:33	hackygolucky_	yup yup
2013-10-17 11:21:45	faddah	also, the tech industry is not free from this either, as much as we want to tell ourselves we so progressive. hackygolucky_, s5fs, et al., have you seen this? => http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631  it is not a pretty read, and gives very real accounts as to why women feel left out of STEM.
2013-10-17 11:21:57	hackygolucky_	anyone know what time events end for this evening's realtime conf stuff?
2013-10-17 11:22:08	hackygolucky_	I know forrest said he'd stop over after
2013-10-17 11:22:17	faddah	also, this =>  http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/11/220748057/why-women-like-me-choose-lower-paying-jobs?sc=17&f=1001
2013-10-17 11:23:46	hackygolucky_	I find I'm exhausting myself with conversations about stuff like ^^^
2013-10-17 11:23:56	hackygolucky_	I have to take vacations from thinking about it.
2013-10-17 11:23:58	hackygolucky_	:-/
2013-10-17 11:24:23	faddah	hackyygolucky_ - i apologize. i'll stop. i just see a lot of it and don't like it. so i do what i can.
2013-10-17 11:25:41	hackygolucky_	faddah: oh no apologies!
2013-10-17 11:25:46	hackygolucky_	it's an interesting read
2013-10-17 11:25:52	faddah	anyway, gotta post gig info on fb & g+, then i'll post to #pdxtech
2013-10-17 11:25:54	hackygolucky_	I appreciate people willing to discuss
2013-10-17 11:26:16	hackygolucky_	many people wouldn't post that with a 10ft pole out of fear
2013-10-17 11:27:29	s5fs	there's a plethora of articles that agree with any viewpoint any of us hold
2013-10-17 11:27:34	s5fs	so, like, what's truth?
2013-10-17 11:28:09	hackygolucky_	right right
2013-10-17 11:28:14	hackygolucky_	I appreciate perspective
2013-10-17 11:28:22	hackygolucky_	I don't think I'm interested in a single truth :)
2013-10-17 11:28:57	faddah	hackygolucky_ - fear of what? these are people's real experiences.
2013-10-17 11:29:03	s5fs	i'm currently happy enough just walking the path towards understanding. i find that often when i hit the end of the path, i'm bored.
2013-10-17 11:29:48	faddah	s5fs - i do, however, believe certain events are an objective, absolute truth. painting them as “any viewpoint & supporting argument is valid” is a false equivalency.
2013-10-17 11:30:13	faddah	s5fs - i cannot deny, for example, women in the first post had those experiences and that was very unjust.
2013-10-17 11:30:46	s5fs	faddah: i was speaking more about the ability for individuals to isolate themselves by creating echo chambers

2013-10-18 11:43:53	hackygolucky_	s5fs: see? who needs to opensource their bio?
2013-10-18 11:43:58	hackygolucky_	you've got yours made :P
2013-10-18 11:44:46	s5fs	haha!! i forget if i actually made my bio a repo or not
2013-10-18 11:45:01	s5fs	I need to track the events i've been a part of though, stickers alone isn't enough
2013-10-18 11:51:45	manimal	I made my home site a repo as a sample site, I think it's a pretty good idea.
2013-10-18 11:54:09	s5fs	my site consists of a picture of a pig
2013-10-18 11:54:28	manimal	lol
2013-10-18 11:54:31	s5fs	well and a map of who has tried to ssh into my host
2013-10-18 11:54:59	manimal	lol
2013-10-18 11:55:13	manimal	and all the ips of everyone who's visited :)
2013-10-18 11:55:37	s5fs	yup
2013-10-18 11:55:59	s5fs	grab the ip, run it thru a geolookup service, plop a pin. simple as a pimple.
2013-10-18 11:56:29	s5fs	i only get 500 queries/hour against the geo service tho, learned that the hard way during dev haha
2013-10-18 11:56:49	manimal	you could just publish the google analytics data
2013-10-18 11:57:19	s5fs	how?
2013-10-18 11:57:36	s5fs	crap i haven't looked at my ga stats ever for that site, do i even have it on there?
2013-10-18 11:57:49	manimal	you can export all their data via their api
2013-10-18 11:57:50	s5fs	haha i totally do
2013-10-18 11:58:05	s5fs	the map is tracking who has failed to ssh into my host, not those who have hit my page
2013-10-18 11:58:10	s5fs	i guess i could spin up a separate map
2013-10-18 11:58:13	manimal	ah
2013-10-18 11:58:29	s5fs	thats why i call 'em jerks
2013-10-18 12:05:02	Wraithan	hi manimal !

2013-10-18 15:48:24	Wraithan	like does the shift register make its connections before breaking them them? who knows, can't tell from the datasheet
2013-10-18 15:49:17	Wraithan	so now I get to program two boards, one to occilate one pin of the shift register after turning all the pins on, and the other to read all the pins of the shift register and see if they all flicker or just the one that should

2013-10-21 10:25:32	dlmanning	Maciek416: yeah I dunno
2013-10-21 10:26:00	hackygolucky_	"Should we be encouraging women to get into the pipeline when we know the pipeline leads to a sewage treatment plant?"
2013-10-21 10:26:14	hackygolucky_	and my thought was, yeah, we could at least prepare people for the reality
2013-10-21 10:26:27	hackygolucky_	instead of telling them they'll get fancy standing desks and unlimited beer
2013-10-21 10:26:48	hackygolucky_	I don't think it needs to be gender specific.
2013-10-21 10:27:24	Maciek416	dlmanning: the other thing is the format, i.e sending out an asynchronous homework assignment
2013-10-21 10:27:44	dlmanning	Maciek416: yeah?
2013-10-21 10:27:52	Maciek416	maybe people do better if they're isolated away from awesome other stuff to do and boot-camped
2013-10-21 10:28:55	Maciek416	though this is like a professional continuing ed. thing though no? out of own pocket? so that's kinda nuts if they're still ditching it I guess
2013-10-21 10:29:58	dlmanning	Maciek416: This is what I'm saying
2013-10-21 10:30:16	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: Well, I'd love for you to drop the mic on them whenever you've got the time
2013-10-21 10:30:33	Maciek416	solution: increase price by factor of 6
2013-10-21 10:30:38	Maciek416	;)
2013-10-21 10:30:51	dlmanning	ha
2013-10-21 10:31:56	Maciek416	way back in the stone age i took this course about learning and the professor was really big on this idea that virtual/tele learnign wasn't going to pan out in the long run
2013-10-21 10:32:09	Maciek416	like that people really need to be tutored by a master, in person, amongst other students
2013-10-21 10:32:20	Maciek416	to feel the motivation of not disappointing the master, in person
2013-10-21 10:32:47	Maciek416	when the master is there looking you in the eye and other people can see you blush, you're motivated to at least give it a go
2013-10-21 10:33:17	miniml	Hi all. I just wanted to show you my first node app. I showed it to Ben at the last meeting, but now I have it completed: http://mem.pe
2013-10-21 10:33:41	miniml	It's a code paste that stores the pastes in the browser's local storage, then shares them via web sockets.
2013-10-21 10:33:42	Maciek416	I don't have the readings we did handy or anything but it was pretty convincing stuff, it feels like the bigger and more disconnected from the "Master" the auditorium gets, the more likely you are to sulk in the background
2013-10-21 10:33:44	Maciek416	(or cheat)
2013-10-21 10:33:58	miniml	So this http://mem.pe/#sge/5 you will be pulling from my browser
2013-10-21 10:34:19	miniml	once I close my browser, it won't be available anymore
2013-10-21 10:34:32	miniml	(sorry to talk over Maciek416 )
2013-10-21 10:34:40	Maciek416	i'm trying your thing
2013-10-21 10:34:41	Maciek416	haha
2013-10-21 10:35:02	miniml	Github repo in the "about" link
2013-10-21 10:35:14	Maciek416	miniml: so you can see this ?
2013-10-21 10:35:14	Maciek416	http://mem.pe/#mv14sg/1
2013-10-21 10:35:38	miniml	I see your function
2013-10-21 10:35:47	Maciek416	that is pretty cool
2013-10-21 10:37:37	Maciek416	how does your client know where to connect to ?
2013-10-21 10:37:47	Maciek416	if my pastie is stored on local storage
2013-10-21 10:37:57	miniml	When you connect to the socket, you get a name
2013-10-21 10:38:03	miniml	yours is mv14sg
2013-10-21 10:38:18	miniml	but you can change it in the settings, if you're vane like me
2013-10-21 10:38:38	Maciek416	so your server knows mv14sg lives at my IP but doesn't store any of the code snippets
2013-10-21 10:39:09	miniml	so when you send your link to anyone, the websocket connection will look for your name and pull the paste
2013-10-21 10:39:40	Maciek416	it pulls it directly from me without your server intervening ?
2013-10-21 10:39:44	miniml	Maciek416: as long as you have your browser logged on to mem.pe you are connected to it via websocket
2013-10-21 10:40:07	dlmanning	miniml: That's really cool
2013-10-21 10:40:12	miniml	the server is intervening. It facilitates the socket connection
2013-10-21 10:40:17	dlmanning	Kudos for rolling it yourself
2013-10-21 10:40:29	Maciek416	ah ok
2013-10-21 10:40:30	miniml	dlmanning: thanks!
2013-10-21 10:40:36	Maciek416	so that's how
2013-10-21 10:40:37	Maciek416	hehe
2013-10-21 10:41:29	Maciek416	would be neat to throw something like Persona on this so I can limit who can see my stuff to my own web of trust
2013-10-21 10:42:06	miniml	I am working on password protecting a paste
2013-10-21 10:42:28	miniml	At the moment anyone can see all your pastes, if they change the number at the end of the url
2013-10-21 10:42:35	miniml	which is the ID of the paste
2013-10-21 10:43:22	Maciek416	right

2013-10-21 15:31:22	nvcexploder	found something cool in my yard yesterday ...
2013-10-21 15:32:23	dlmanning	A meteorite?!?!
2013-10-21 15:32:29	dlmanning	Did it give you super powers?
2013-10-21 15:32:37	nvcexploder	sorta
2013-10-21 15:32:43	nvcexploder	it was a patch of chanterelles
2013-10-21 15:32:58	nvcexploder	and it gave me powers of delicious meals.
2013-10-21 15:33:04	dlmanning	ha
2013-10-21 15:44:51	hackygolucky_	yum!
2013-10-21 15:44:56	hackygolucky_	saw the pics people were tweeting out
2013-10-21 15:45:03	hackygolucky_	and by people I just mean one of you.
2013-10-21 15:46:01	dlmanning	nvcexploder: What was the deal with the Aaron Paul cameo at RTC?
2013-10-21 15:46:34	nvcexploder	that was all Eran Hammer.
2013-10-21 15:46:39	hackygolucky_	heh, WHAT?
2013-10-21 15:46:51	nvcexploder	not just him
2013-10-21 15:47:05	dlmanning	Was it really Aaron Paul live?
2013-10-21 15:47:15	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I just forwarded you an email about someone wanting to hear about nodebots day and hardware
2013-10-21 15:47:50	nvcexploder	dlmanning: it was a recording
2013-10-21 15:48:10	nvcexploder	also, the chefs from 2 of the top 5 restaurants in the world were a recording
2013-10-21 15:48:11	dlmanning	But it was a recording that Eran Hammer arranged specifically for that talk?
2013-10-21 15:48:16	nvcexploder	yep
2013-10-21 15:48:21	dlmanning	How the hell did he do that?
2013-10-21 15:48:51	nvcexploder	he flew to New York and Spain and talked to them.
2013-10-21 15:49:05	dlmanning	Good grief
2013-10-21 15:49:13	nvcexploder	AND
2013-10-21 15:49:18	nvcexploder	he built a garden

2013-10-21 15:57:29	nvcexploder	yep!
2013-10-21 15:57:57	dlmanning	So this year was the last one?
2013-10-21 15:59:10	hackygolucky_	wha?
2013-10-21 15:59:16	hackygolucky_	weird. They aren't doing it again?
2013-10-21 16:01:12	nvcexploder	it correct.
2013-10-21 16:01:15	nvcexploder	wait
2013-10-21 16:01:17	nvcexploder	just correct
2013-10-21 16:01:29	nvcexploder	Eran's talk was really crazy - y'all should watch it when it's available
2013-10-21 16:05:20	dlmanning	nvcexploder: So awhile ago RTC offered discounted tickets to women who would commit to submitting a talk next year
2013-10-21 16:05:30	dlmanning	But there's not going to be a conference next year?
2013-10-21 16:05:38	nvcexploder	oh noes! I remember that
2013-10-21 16:05:40	nvcexploder	yeah
2013-10-21 16:05:43	dlmanning	Did they change their mind recently?
2013-10-21 16:05:49	nvcexploder	I think so -
2013-10-21 16:05:57	nvcexploder	during the after party on the last day -
2013-10-21 16:06:14	dlmanning	So, what happened?
2013-10-21 16:06:20	JSON_voorhees	a brawl

2013-10-22 09:21:09	hackygolucky_	previously lived in seattle prior to pdx
2013-10-22 09:21:13	hackygolucky_	pdx is the BEST
2013-10-22 09:21:25	hackygolucky_	crazy vibrant developer community

2013-10-22 09:22:57	taterbase	hackygolucky_: awesome that's what I like to hear :) I keep hearing that the PDX tech community may not be as big as I'm looking for but I always hear otherwise
2013-10-22 09:22:58	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: have you considered Go?
2013-10-22 09:23:13	taterbase	That was a contradictory sentence
2013-10-22 09:23:17	taterbase	Anyway, thanks for the insight
2013-10-22 09:23:24	hackygolucky_	taterbase: there's a pretty diverse group of companies to choose from in size, stage, and focus
2013-10-22 09:23:33	taterbase	I'm just looking for active intelligent communities to help me grow
2013-10-22 09:23:41	taterbase	And tons of open source activity
2013-10-22 09:23:53	hackygolucky_	our monthly node group pulls in about 35 people per presentation night
2013-10-22 09:23:57	taterbase	!!!
2013-10-22 09:24:00	taterbase	That's awesome
2013-10-22 09:24:00	hackygolucky_	we also have an official hacknight

2013-10-22 09:24:14	hackygolucky_	and impromptu ones inbetween that
2013-10-22 09:24:25	hackygolucky_	we have a local conference that drew 200 last year
2013-10-22 09:24:32	taterbase	Yeah I saw that, almost went
2013-10-22 09:24:34	hackygolucky_	and we'll be having cascadiajs here in 2014
2013-10-22 09:24:48	hackygolucky_	they python community is also very hearty here
2013-10-22 09:24:59	hackygolucky_	(not that you're interested in that, per se)
2013-10-22 09:25:05	hackygolucky_	as well as ruby
2013-10-22 09:26:06	taterbase	That's really great to hear :) do most developers live on the west side of the burnside bridge? Downtown?

2013-10-23 12:22:10	chrisdickinson	the goal is ultimately to make this sort of thing more approachable and hopefully inspire people to take tooling using these concepts further
2013-10-23 12:22:54	chrisdickinson	so there's a little element of "tech demo" to it, but it's there to give an idea of what's possible vs. what the endpoint is
2013-10-23 12:23:25	Maciek416	yeah I think access to the AST and toying with code-as-data in js is still a pretty foreign concept for most js folks
2013-10-23 12:23:38	Maciek416	but given how small the language is
2013-10-23 12:23:51	Maciek416	seems like once everything is in place a lot of tools would spring up
2013-10-23 12:24:03	chrisdickinson	i'd like to see it get to be as easy/natural for folks as using jquery to manipulate the DOM
2013-10-23 12:24:45	Maciek416	like console.log("You have " + $("function[args.length=2]") + " functions that take exactly two arguments in your code")
2013-10-23 12:26:37	Maciek416	chrisdickinson: how about who-likely-wrote-this-code forensics ?
2013-10-23 12:26:41	chrisdickinson	yep! or `$('function#named_like_so > if').each(function(idx, sel) { sel.before("console.log('hello world');") })
2013-10-23 12:26:44	chrisdickinson	`
2013-10-23 12:26:52	Maciek416	download all js code and commits from github
2013-10-23 12:26:57	Maciek416	generate stats
2013-10-23 12:27:00	Maciek416	take anonymous code
2013-10-23 12:27:04	Maciek416	find out who wrote it
2013-10-23 12:27:05	Maciek416	;)
2013-10-23 12:27:31	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-10-23 12:27:45	Maciek416	what about sel.before({ something that isn't a string but is a tree of built-up generated code }) ?
2013-10-23 12:28:35	Maciek416	I guess we'd find out pretty quick that the internet's javascript is like 90% TJ
2013-10-23 12:28:40	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-10-23 12:29:40	chrisdickinson	or, *really* stretching the limits of what's possible: sel.on('execute', function(exec) { /* run this code */ })

2013-10-23 12:31:57	chrisdickinson	or higher order selectors like `$('function#named_like_so :variable("$")').rename('ender')`

2013-10-23 16:38:55	Wraithan	I'm considering bringing a router so we can just do our own local network

2013-10-23 16:41:13	hackygolucky_	and the last time we rode to seattle it was horrible.
2013-10-23 16:41:38	hackygolucky_	we could do something with a mifi instead, however, and make a fun go of it.

2013-10-24 11:11:52	nvcexploder	howdy folks.
2013-10-24 11:13:13	dlmanning	'sup dawg
2013-10-24 11:13:20	justinabrahms	is closure compiler the main thing that validates type signatures?
2013-10-24 11:13:42	justinabrahms	We're having an internal discussion about documenting rough types for public js methods. Choices are jsdoc or something I'm considering which is lighter weight.
2013-10-24 11:14:19	justinabrahms	I bascially want:   // fn(object) => string      style annotations
2013-10-24 11:15:10	justinabrahms	gets a little weird with deeply nested options objects though, and optional params. // (string!, string!, Number?, fn?, fn?) => Number
2013-10-24 11:19:12	chrisdickinson	aah
2013-10-24 11:19:15	chrisdickinson	one sec, jden had a thing
2013-10-24 11:19:34	chrisdickinson	https://github.com/jden/jsig
2013-10-24 11:20:51	chrisdickinson	i personally tend to document type signatures in my README as part of the API section
2013-10-24 11:20:59	chrisdickinson	and only then, loosely
2013-10-24 11:21:16	justinabrahms	that doesn't work for our style of coding, unfortunately.
2013-10-24 11:21:50	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-10-24 11:21:53	chrisdickinson	there's another thing...
2013-10-24 11:22:58	chrisdickinson	ah, it might be a bit less than you want
2013-10-24 11:22:59	chrisdickinson	https://npmjs.org/package/function-comment
2013-10-24 11:24:17	chrisdickinson	(part of thlorenz's replpad project which is itself pretty cool: https://npmjs.org/package/replpad)
2013-10-24 11:25:17	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: are you looking more for "documentation generation", "type validation", or "documentation-based type validation"?
2013-10-24 11:25:21	justinabrahms	function-comment is very similar to jsdoc
2013-10-24 11:25:39	justinabrahms	the question became: "How do we document APIs that we want others to use?"
2013-10-24 11:25:50	chrisdickinson	because if type validation is the goal I'd say typescript is a decent language to write externally-facing apis in
2013-10-24 11:26:05	justinabrahms	for example: a modal jquery plugin someone's making
2013-10-24 11:26:07	chrisdickinson	there was talk for a bit in the node crowd about using it for node's builtin JS modules
2013-10-24 11:26:17	justinabrahms	one option is google closure-style jsdocs: http://i.imgur.com/GGZk6Sb.png
2013-10-24 11:26:47	justinabrahms	things I like about it is it clearly documents the mandatory and optional arguments.
2013-10-24 11:27:07	justinabrahms	but I find that really painful to write. I'd rather write  (string, string, string, fn?, fn?) => null
2013-10-24 11:27:57	justinabrahms	if you wanted to know "well, what's that second string?".. you could just look at the function (unless you're getting IDE stuff involved)
2013-10-24 11:28:22	justinabrahms	dunno. Will probably end up doing jsdoc in hopes someone writes cool integrations for it that we can use. :)
2013-10-24 11:29:03	chrisdickinson	:) i'll ponder for a bit!

2013-10-24 11:34:14	s5fs	I'm sitting at pdx waiting to fly to sf for js.everywhere
2013-10-24 11:34:28	Wraithan	s5fs: nice
2013-10-24 11:34:39	justinabrahms	I think you mean js.san-francisco
2013-10-24 11:34:41	Wraithan	I'm sitting in Seattle and hacking while I wait for lunchtime to roll around
2013-10-24 11:34:41	s5fs	i've decided NOT to do a slide deck for my talk, just to talk
2013-10-24 11:34:43	justinabrahms	otherwise, you could stay here. ;)
2013-10-24 11:34:49	Wraithan	s5fs: nice!
2013-10-24 11:35:09	s5fs	justinabrahms: y'know, i didn't even ask if i could stay here, i just took the plane ticket w/o asking
2013-10-24 11:35:24	justinabrahms	:)
2013-10-24 11:35:27	s5fs	anything to get a super steak with sour cream from el faro
2013-10-24 11:36:02	justinabrahms	feel free to not answer this, but did the conference buy the ticket and did they do that for all speakers? or is it just a special thing you worked out?
2013-10-24 11:36:39	justinabrahms	curious as I would probably submit talks to more places if there wasn't such high costs involved.
2013-10-24 11:38:17	s5fs	justinabrahms: sorry i'm laggy here
2013-10-24 11:38:36	s5fs	justinabrahms: i don't know if all speakers had flights covered, but i was under the impression that they had some funds set aside for travel and lodging for speakers
2013-10-24 11:39:14	s5fs	i've been fortunate that all of the talks i've attended this year covered my flights. i don't have PTO so taking time off work is already pretty costly.

2013-10-29 10:05:51	jarofghosts	hello
2013-10-29 10:05:58	ednapiranha	a bird told me that a meat was being spaced

2013-10-29 10:06:31	JSON_voorhees	I was mentioned that it would be cool to have you speak at the node pdx meetup bout that meat
2013-10-29 10:06:36	jarofghosts	these questions are out of my depth as ive never needed to use page-specific pdfs as supporting documentation
2013-10-29 10:06:45	ednapiranha	JSON_voorhees: yes that would be fun
2013-10-29 10:06:48	ednapiranha	but we need the bros to appear
2013-10-29 10:06:49	chrisdickinson	jarofghosts: so one thing sphinx can do is output pdfs instead of html
2013-10-29 10:06:52	ednapiranha	like a stage production?
2013-10-29 10:06:58	jarofghosts	ah
2013-10-29 10:07:00	chrisdickinson	while still supporting linking between topics in that outgoing pdf
2013-10-29 10:07:02	jarofghosts	thats kind of neat

2013-10-29 10:07:18	JSON_voorhees	haha we will need weedbro for sure
2013-10-29 10:07:23	ednapiranha	he's moving to LA this week
2013-10-29 10:07:26	ednapiranha	or next week
2013-10-29 10:07:26	jarofghosts	i cant imagine its impossible to make a markdown processor that does that, though
2013-10-29 10:07:31	JSON_voorhees	I know :( 
2013-10-29 10:07:32	chrisdickinson	(and LaTeX output as well, and epub, if i'm not mistaken)

2013-10-29 10:07:43	JSON_voorhees	he said he might try and stop in one his way tho
2013-10-29 10:07:50	jarofghosts	to me the syntax is most important, because tooling can be developed
2013-10-29 10:07:52	JSON_voorhees	haha perfect
2013-10-29 10:08:03	ednapiranha	JSON_voorhees: if only the ladybros appeared in a group

2013-10-29 10:09:11	ericholscher	jarofghosts: it doesn't have syntax for the stuff that Sphinx supports, and if it did, it would likely end up uglier
2013-10-29 10:09:14	ednapiranha	i'll be on there in a bit.. still finishing up some real work (tm)

2013-10-29 10:22:57	ericholscher	we got a sweet new search interface
2013-10-29 10:24:11	ericholscher	really excited to roll it out
2013-10-29 10:25:52	JSON_voorhees	ericholscher: that's great man!
2013-10-29 10:31:39	ericholscher	yea, pretty excited about it

2013-10-29 10:43:26	ericholscher	heh
2013-10-29 10:43:33	ericholscher	i really wish I could draw
2013-10-29 10:43:33	AWinterman	(for those of you who don't know: http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/)
2013-10-29 10:43:41	AWinterman	also I tried doing this once
2013-10-29 10:43:45	AWinterman	and it was terrible
2013-10-29 10:43:54	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-10-29 10:44:13	chrisdickinson	"my documentation seems too easy to write, i should fix that"
2013-10-29 10:44:51	jarofghosts	i prefer my documentation to be a collection of shell scripts that use my project in every conceivable way
2013-10-29 10:44:55	jarofghosts	no surprises
2013-10-29 10:45:25	jarofghosts	no ambiguity
2013-10-29 10:47:12	ericholscher	fuzzdoc
2013-10-29 10:47:19	AWinterman	heh
2013-10-29 10:47:22	jarofghosts	that also takes care of the i18n problem
2013-10-29 10:47:25	AWinterman	just fuzz input and then error codes
2013-10-29 10:47:41	AWinterman	oh god, i18n is the worst abrev ever
2013-10-29 10:47:49	jarofghosts	you mean a3v
2013-10-29 10:48:00	jarofghosts	or a10n
2013-10-29 10:48:46	AWinterman	heh
2013-10-29 10:49:25	jarofghosts	it solves a real problem because storage is in such short supply and words are hard
2013-10-29 11:00:31	adamdicarlo	a10n? agonization?
2013-10-29 11:00:56	adamdicarlo	oh darn, that'd be a9n. seriously though, all i've heard are i18n and l20n
2013-10-29 11:01:01	jarofghosts	abbreviation
2013-10-29 11:01:06	adamdicarlo	*oh* haha
2013-10-29 11:17:18	AWinterman	ericholscher: I think the main thing actually missing from markdown is handling a graph of files
2013-10-29 11:17:56	ericholscher	and all the language features that provides
2013-10-29 11:18:55	AWinterman	ericholscher: I could see an expansion of markdown that just provided syntax for traversing the graph (e.g. linking to a parent or sibling) that wouldn't cause too much bloat
2013-10-29 11:19:07	ericholscher	multimarkdown can do it
2013-10-29 11:19:12	ericholscher	i think

2013-10-29 11:19:51	ericholscher	at least it can do it intradocument: https://rawgithub.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html
2013-10-29 11:19:52	AWinterman	so is multimarkdown just markdown + pandoc, but a little less?
2013-10-29 11:20:33	AWinterman	I mean all you need for intradocument is a way to set ids

2013-10-29 11:25:31	ericholscher	right, and the graph
2013-10-29 11:25:46	ericholscher	sadly sphinx's support for referencing is crappy :(
2013-10-29 11:26:03	ericholscher	well, not crappy, but annoying
2013-10-29 11:27:08	dlmanning	Any of you guys use Marked on OSX?
2013-10-29 11:30:48	AWinterman	dlmanning: I've used it
2013-10-29 11:30:57	AWinterman	seemed pretty okay
2013-10-29 11:31:40	dlmanning	I like that it handles code highlighting in GFM
2013-10-29 11:32:21	AWinterman	dlmanning: http://npm.im/markdown-preview
2013-10-29 11:32:24	AWinterman	you might like that
2013-10-29 11:34:15	dlmanning	That looks cool
2013-10-29 11:34:23	dlmanning	Ironically, it needs better docs :/

2013-10-29 11:36:30	dlmanning	Oh wow
2013-10-29 11:36:37	dlmanning	That's some next level shit
2013-10-29 11:37:03	AWinterman	I am using that all over the place

2013-10-29 11:37:11	AWinterman	(as in I will now)
2013-10-29 11:38:19	ericholscher	WHAT DOES IT DO
2013-10-29 11:38:37	AWinterman	ericholscher: puts markdown in yer terminal
2013-10-29 11:39:03	ericholscher	too much cute, not enough words
2013-10-29 11:39:14	AWinterman	seemed pretty clear to me
2013-10-29 11:40:02	AWinterman	it kind of suffers on a light background
2013-10-29 11:41:32	dlmanning	AWinterman: What kind of monster has a light background in their terminal?
2013-10-29 11:41:47	 *	AWinterman <------
2013-10-29 11:41:52	AWinterman	that one
2013-10-29 11:42:13	AWinterman	i actually switch between black, beige, and white
2013-10-29 11:43:38	dlmanning	AWinterman: My therapist is pretty good with that kind of stuff
2013-10-29 11:43:54	AWinterman	dlmanning: hah

2013-10-29 14:21:00	jarofghosts	hackygolucky whats the format like for doing a quick talk like you mentioned? just get up there and say something?

2013-10-31 14:16:21	hackygolucky	ruby has gotten very good as-of-late with making a cofc prominent
2013-10-31 14:16:21	chrisdickinson	didn't we work on one at the outset?

2013-10-31 14:16:34	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: short one, yes.
2013-10-31 14:16:42	hackygolucky	but we didn't put it up for community input
2013-10-31 14:16:57	hackygolucky	and it could stand to be a -little- more defined.

2013-10-31 14:24:15	faddah	one question, however - is there some precipitating event that has caused this to be brought up? or just noticing we've let it slide without one for too long?

2013-11-01 15:03:25	drueck	I guess WordPress bought out Gravatar or something? Or were they always part of the same organization?
2013-11-01 15:04:06	Wraithan	2997 Automatic bought them
2013-11-01 15:04:22	Wraithan	er
2013-11-01 15:04:25	Wraithan	2007
2013-11-01 15:04:35	drueck	Ah, I see.
2013-11-01 15:04:47	Wraithan	http://blog.gravatar.com/2007/10/18/automattic-gravatar/
2013-11-01 15:06:17	drueck	This is way off the original topic, but I was just annoyed that I even had to create an Email address for our github organization in order to set an avatar...
2013-11-01 15:06:30	drueck	We would never use that email address for anything (at least in the forseable future).
2013-11-01 15:06:43	drueck	It was just kinda crazy the steps required just to change that image.  :)
2013-11-01 15:07:18	drueck	That being said, I do think Gravatar is a cool idea.

2013-11-08 11:50:43	chrisdickinson	nope
2013-11-08 11:50:55	chrisdickinson	though design is evaluating it
2013-11-08 11:51:33	justinabrahms	Hoping I can convince you at some point in the future to walk me through https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/lib/less/parser.js so I get a sense of what the heck it's doing.
2013-11-08 11:51:39	justinabrahms	basically a parser for less, which is more or less nested CSS
2013-11-08 11:51:50	chrisdickinson	totally!
2013-11-08 11:52:11	justinabrahms	I have a conceptual idea of what it should be doing, but haven't really walked through code to see how that conceptual idea actually works.
2013-11-08 11:52:16	chrisdickinson	i think we used less back at domain 51
2013-11-08 11:52:25	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-11-08 11:52:32	justinabrahms	My eventual goal is to write something like csssauroncss
2013-11-08 11:52:54	justinabrahms	though it might be different in kind.
2013-11-08 11:58:24	chrisdickinson	ooo.
2013-11-08 11:58:28	chrisdickinson	that would be awesome.
2013-11-08 11:58:52	chrisdickinson	what shape of nodes does less produce?
2013-11-08 11:59:33	justinabrahms	I'm not sure.
2013-11-08 12:00:11	justinabrahms	https://gist.github.com/justinabrahms/46569dc10e9b5b8b1f0f
2013-11-08 12:00:20	justinabrahms	that's an example of some of one of our less files, however.
2013-11-08 12:00:30	justinabrahms	(note this is a known shitty piece of code that's too deeply nested)

2013-11-09 17:36:10	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: oo! what if cssauron-falafel treated (css) classes as "relation type"
2013-11-09 17:36:49	chrisdickinson	for instance, an if statement has up to two blocks, and right now you have to do relational hacks to get to the second one
2013-11-09 17:37:08	chrisdickinson	but this would be `if block.consequent`
2013-11-09 17:37:40	justinabrahms	getting close to method syntax.
2013-11-09 17:37:54	chrisdickinson	hmm?
2013-11-09 17:39:03	justinabrahms	so you're saying that you're going to tag edges in the dependency graph with class names?
2013-11-09 17:39:20	chrisdickinson	well, the relation of nodes to their parent
2013-11-09 17:39:27	chrisdickinson	not necessarily the dependency graph
2013-11-09 17:39:40	chrisdickinson	but yeah, classes would represent the edge name between a node and its parent

2013-11-12 13:47:50	justinabrahms	Maciek416: it was a 48 hour project of 1 developer who wanted a good night's sleep. 
2013-11-12 13:47:54	justinabrahms	:)
2013-11-12 13:48:07	Maciek416	i'm voting for this
2013-11-12 13:48:16	justinabrahms	I'll probably open source it and solicit contributions when judging is done.

2013-11-12 13:48:28	Maciek416	is voting open?
2013-11-12 13:48:28	justinabrahms	I think the live-reloading as you type stuff could be neat.
2013-11-12 13:48:32	justinabrahms	should be...
2013-11-12 13:48:39	justinabrahms	I think there's a vote link in the top right.
2013-11-12 13:48:46	Maciek416	yeah that'd be awesome, would be awesome to see the source

2013-11-12 13:57:13	chrisdickinson	oh yeah, i remember that

2013-11-12 14:00:09	AWinterman	chrisdickinson / justinabrahms they disagreed with it the first time?
2013-11-12 14:00:34	chrisdickinson	well, there was a bit of an uproar iirc
2013-11-12 14:00:39	chrisdickinson	and a lot of naysaying
2013-11-12 14:01:34	AWinterman	they disagreed with the premise that js is a bit janky?
2013-11-12 14:01:41	AWinterman	(and ahrd to work with?)
2013-11-12 14:02:14	justinabrahms	a lot of the naysaying around dart, if I recall, is "it's java for the browser"
2013-11-12 14:02:20	chrisdickinson	disagreed with the idea of google putting more effort behind a "proprietary" new language for the browser -- dart
2013-11-12 14:02:26	justinabrahms	or "this is the browser wars all over again"
2013-11-12 14:03:00	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-11-12 14:03:46	chrisdickinson	i actually much prefer the "Evolve JS" approach
2013-11-12 14:04:27	justinabrahms	Is there ever a reason to make a clean break?
2013-11-12 14:04:28	chrisdickinson	and also keeping in mind that this was 3-ish years ago, frontend JS was still coming out of the dark ages
2013-11-12 14:05:04	chrisdickinson	i'm hopeful that the "clean break" is that asm.js becomes a strong platform for other languages to compile to.
2013-11-12 14:05:30	chrisdickinson	and ES6 does make the language more palatable to newcomers
2013-11-12 14:06:01	chrisdickinson	(though it sacrifices a bit of the "JS is a small language" flavor I love to get there)
2013-11-12 14:06:35	chrisdickinson	and i just realized that it did kind of get kwargs :\
2013-11-12 14:07:11	chrisdickinson	fn = ((x, {a, b, c}) => { return x + a + b + c + d }); fn(3, {a: 2, b: 3, c: 1}) === 9
2013-11-12 14:07:39	chrisdickinson	(destructuring works in params as well)
2013-11-12 14:10:35	justinabrahms	where does d come from?
2013-11-12 14:11:04	justinabrahms	default arg js magic which turns into 0?
2013-11-12 14:11:36	AWinterman	woah

2013-11-17 18:39:13	indexzero	hackygolucky: I was told there were cool kids here?
2013-11-17 18:39:16	hackygolucky	first of all, thanks again for the stickers.
2013-11-17 18:39:21	hackygolucky	indexzero: hey hey hey
2013-11-17 18:39:31	dlmanning	hackygolucky: Sure, glad it was satisfactory
2013-11-17 18:39:40	indexzero	right-click -> "autojoin room"
2013-11-17 18:39:57	hackygolucky	as all good rooms should be.
2013-11-17 18:40:24	hackygolucky	dlmanning: secondly, would you be amiable in bringing the codeschoolers to the pdxnode pres night if it's the second week of December?
2013-11-17 18:40:37	dlmanning	hackygolucky: Yes, that's the plan
2013-11-17 18:40:40	hackygolucky	should have an ircbot tutorial and meatspac.es talk.
2013-11-17 18:40:45	hackygolucky	eeexcellent.
2013-11-17 18:41:02	hackygolucky	also, I have seen meatspac.es and it is good. Horribly good.
2013-11-17 18:41:07	hackygolucky	I was tricked into it.
2013-11-17 18:41:17	hackygolucky	I refused for too long.
2013-11-17 18:41:21	dlmanning	Yeah, I took Peter on it awhile back
2013-11-17 18:41:27	hackygolucky	indexzero: you meatspace?

2013-11-17 18:41:44	Wraithan	indexzero: do I know you as another name?
2013-11-17 18:41:57	hackygolucky	oh, you'd also prob have to be up late unless we're idling on it at work.
2013-11-17 18:42:10	hackygolucky	which I wouldn't be surprised I'd do depending on the day.
2013-11-17 18:42:13	indexzero	Wraithan: I've used this handle for 10 years, so unless you mean IRL?
2013-11-17 18:42:23	hackygolucky	:)
2013-11-17 18:42:42	indexzero	hackygolucky: Meatspac.es and this: https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/396874170299981824
2013-11-17 18:42:44	Wraithan	Right, I've been this handle for years and years too, I more meant have I met you at a conf or user group?
2013-11-17 18:42:47	hackygolucky	dlmanning: I'll get the space confirmed and the announcement out and get you the link.
2013-11-17 18:42:59	hackygolucky	indexzero: goddamit.
2013-11-17 18:43:02	hackygolucky	friggin' zed.
2013-11-17 18:43:06	dlmanning	hackygolucky: huh?
2013-11-17 18:43:13	indexzero	Wraithan: Likely. I spoke at the first NodeConf in Portland
2013-11-17 18:43:26	Wraithan	indexzero: I didn't go to that, just one or two of the parties
2013-11-17 18:43:28	indexzero	and the second one come to think of it
2013-11-17 18:43:30	hackygolucky	dlmanning: for the meeetup. In case the codeschoolers want a link.
2013-11-17 18:43:32	hackygolucky	I don't know.
2013-11-17 18:43:42	dlmanning	okay :)
2013-11-17 18:44:10	hackygolucky	indexzero: but to be fair, it's the same reason I didn't go on it at first mention :P
2013-11-17 18:44:12	Wraithan	I guess, not, just looked you up on the twitters
2013-11-17 18:44:40	indexzero	Wraithan: yes, I'm not actually living in Portland.
2013-11-17 18:44:51	hackygolucky	honorary pdxer.
2013-11-17 18:45:15	Wraithan	not enough beard
2013-11-17 18:45:29	Wraithan	indexzero: are you snobby about coffee or beer?
2013-11-17 18:45:30	Wraithan	:)
2013-11-17 18:45:40	indexzero	I'm snobby about very little, but I geek out a lot
2013-11-17 18:45:51	indexzero	hackygolucky saw me geek the f* out about my hot sauce
2013-11-17 18:46:30	Wraithan	indexzero: how do you feed about secret aardvark sauce?
2013-11-17 18:47:06	Wraithan	feed? feel
2013-11-17 18:47:27	indexzero	I don't live on the west coast either so I'd never heard of it
2013-11-17 18:47:32	indexzero	looks like their distribution is pretty regional
2013-11-17 18:47:50	indexzero	but looks right up my alley!
2013-11-17 18:47:54	Wraithan	indexzero: pretty much only PacNW
2013-11-17 18:48:06	dlmanning	aardvark is awesome
2013-11-17 18:48:10	Wraithan	you should try it when you are in town, it is delicious
2013-11-17 18:48:19	Wraithan	I go through it by the case
2013-11-17 18:48:22	Wraithan	so good
2013-11-17 18:48:34	dlmanning	Really good on eggs
2013-11-17 18:48:43	indexzero	I'm a big fan of Melinda's, Marie Sharps and Cajohn
2013-11-17 18:49:18	indexzero	http://www.cajohns.com/ is pretty solid for er'thing
2013-11-17 18:49:34	hackygolucky	indexzero: when do we get to place orders?
2013-11-17 18:49:41	indexzero	hackygolucky: lol. never
2013-11-17 18:49:47	hackygolucky	it sounds AMAZING
2013-11-17 18:49:51	hackygolucky	noooooo
2013-11-17 18:49:52	indexzero	I turned my last hobby into a company
2013-11-17 18:49:58	indexzero	not sure I'm ready to do that agin
2013-11-17 18:50:00	indexzero	*again
2013-11-17 18:50:08	indexzero	it's important to have actual hobbies me thinks
2013-11-17 18:50:32	dlmanning	that's why I enjoy taxidermy
2013-11-17 18:50:58	hackygolucky	well maybe one of these days I'll just have to make you place a bet with the sauce as the prize.
2013-11-17 18:51:08	hackygolucky	devil and his gold fiddle
2013-11-17 18:51:14	hackygolucky	so long as I know I can win.
2013-11-17 18:53:43	indexzero	well you can just have some if you come to SF before it's all gone
2013-11-17 18:53:49	indexzero	I have ~10 bottles left here
2013-11-17 18:55:46	jden	dlmanning: for read?
2013-11-17 18:55:49	hackygolucky	well, shoot.

2013-11-17 18:56:13	hackygolucky	dlmanning: wait, you taxidermy?
2013-11-17 18:56:50	jden	hey indexzero, good to see you here
2013-11-17 18:56:57	dlmanning	Building a sqirrel army
2013-11-17 18:57:33	hackygolucky	jden: it's just part of my scheming to get you guys to live here.
2013-11-17 18:58:03	Wraithan	indexzero: I left my last company so I could make my hobby into a full time thing and just do consulting on the side so I can stay afloat
2013-11-17 18:58:12	Wraithan	I think that is the pattern I'm going to follow for now
2013-11-17 18:58:53	Wraithan	Meh, had to proxy through my portland server so I could access spotify and such because they don't have it in CA
2013-11-17 18:59:10	jden	hackygolucky: I lloved that chrisdickinson's suggestion on nodefreinds was "borrow hackygolucky"
2013-11-17 18:59:16	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-11-17 18:59:18	hackygolucky	\o/
2013-11-17 18:59:22	chrisdickinson	it's true!
2013-11-17 18:59:26	jden	but for real
2013-11-17 18:59:29	hackygolucky	yes, please pay for me to regularly travel to SF.
2013-11-17 18:59:30	jden	come help
2013-11-17 18:59:31	hackygolucky	:)
2013-11-17 18:59:31	dlmanning	yeah
2013-11-17 18:59:40	Wraithan	She totally runs everything, we just support her
2013-11-17 18:59:42	jden	don't you have offices down here :)
2013-11-17 18:59:42	hackygolucky	I already wish I could do that with work, so.
2013-11-17 19:00:15	Wraithan	hackygolucky: did I hear right that we are targeting second week of dec?
2013-11-17 19:00:16	hackygolucky	jden: we do, but there is currently no need to fly me down there. Our cross-functional teams are all chosen by location. so theoretically I should never be on a feature from SF.
2013-11-17 19:00:18	Wraithan	instead of first?
2013-11-17 19:00:32	hackygolucky	Wraithan: yes. Because I'm selfish
2013-11-17 19:00:41	Wraithan	hackygolucky: extra week to practice my talk
2013-11-17 19:00:44	Wraithan	I'll take it!
2013-11-17 19:00:45	hackygolucky	I was planning on working all that out tomorrow.
2013-11-17 19:01:01	hackygolucky	Wraithan: do I need to contact uberj or jen about the space?
2013-11-17 19:01:15	Wraithan	hackygolucky: I can let edna know and help her setup the thing in their system for our meetup
2013-11-17 19:01:30	Wraithan	I've done it a bunch so I know all the fields that need to be filled out
2013-11-17 19:01:42	hackygolucky	dear jen, can you please come give an awesome talk AND sponsor the space? k, thanks
2013-11-17 19:01:59	Wraithan	hackygolucky: they know that I do the space stuff, just need a mozilla person to be there from start to end
2013-11-17 19:02:04	jden	hackygolucky: foo.
2013-11-17 19:02:04	Wraithan	:)
2013-11-17 19:02:06	hackygolucky	indexzero: how was the second prop plane back to SF?
2013-11-17 19:02:15	hackygolucky	oh, and I assume you found a place to crash?
2013-11-17 19:02:16	indexzero	I was on a 737
2013-11-17 19:02:25	indexzero	another airbnb for now
2013-11-17 19:02:39	hackygolucky	oh, well that doesn't sound too bad.
2013-11-17 19:02:50	hackygolucky	I was REALLY hoping you'd couchcrash Mikael
2013-11-17 19:07:00	hackygolucky	indexzero: what part of town do you get to enjoy now?
2013-11-17 19:09:05	ericholscher	quite enjoying my vancouver couchcrash
2013-11-17 19:09:24	ericholscher	:)
2013-11-17 19:11:15	hackygolucky	nice!
2013-11-17 19:13:04	chrisdickinson	jden: the logo is artisanal, handwritten SVG I put together while I was on jury duty :\
2013-11-17 19:13:40	hackygolucky	ericholscher: I spaced that you had a place and was just like "DUDE, where's holscher? Is he okay?"
2013-11-17 19:13:45	hackygolucky	totally pulled a momma hacky
2013-11-17 19:13:49	ericholscher	heh :)
2013-11-17 19:16:26	jden	chrisdickinson: excellent use of time :)
2013-11-17 19:16:56	jden	hackygolucky: speaking of, THANK YOU again for letting me crash on your counch in pdx

2013-11-17 21:30:49	jden	fun story: here's what life in Idaho is like. http://blogs.idahostatesman.com/rep-patterson-to-sheriff-raney-the-spotlight-will-be-put-on-you/
2013-11-17 21:33:08	othiym23	most Idahoans are nice people
2013-11-17 21:33:30	othiym23	the ones that aren't terrifying white supremacists, at least
2013-11-17 21:33:36	othiym23	but they've got their issues
2013-11-17 21:33:56	jden	most _people_ I know are nice people. the problem is who gets in and grabs at the power in the community.
2013-11-17 21:34:10	jden	and how that affects other members of that community
2013-11-17 21:34:46	jden	and then the extremists, I suppose, as in the case of white supremacists (who mostly avoided traditional power structures)
2013-11-17 21:35:19	hackygolucky	oof.
2013-11-17 21:36:36	othiym23	when I was getting ready to leave Montana, there were a lot of stories in the media about militias
2013-11-17 21:37:05	othiym23	and how they were all declaring themselves freemen and locking themselves in their cars outside courthouses and refusing to surrender their "territory" to the Man
2013-11-17 21:37:12	jden	ah, where did you live in MT?
2013-11-17 21:37:30	othiym23	the main difference between then and now is that it seems like those loons started going after elected office
2013-11-17 21:38:04	othiym23	Missoula, but my mom's side of the family has roots in Sheridan (which is about 40 miles south of Whitehall, midway between Butte and Bozeman) back to the Civil War
2013-11-17 21:39:08	othiym23	fun fact: Bryce Baril and I are probably at least distantly related, because we both have family roots in Sheridan (pop: ~650)
2013-11-17 21:39:49	s5fs	thats funny
2013-11-17 21:39:50	jden	ah, neat. I lived briefly in Stevensville and Big Fork growing up
2013-11-17 21:41:17	JSON_voorheez	whats up jden

2013-11-17 21:47:03	othiym23	Wraithan: neat, I have something to do that but it requires ssh and some sorta bullshitty Perl scripts and talks directly to my weechat instance via a named pipe

2013-11-19 10:40:45	chrisdickinson	hiiiiiii.
2013-11-19 10:40:55	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: re: the twitter things -- you're looking for a way to cache the node_modules/ directory for your project outside of the local filesystem?
2013-11-19 10:40:57	chrisdickinson	(because drone.io's fs is ephemeral?)
2013-11-19 10:41:58	justinabrahms	chrisdickinson: yes. apparently I thought a lot of this conversation was around a tweet I never posted around nodejs deployment :-P
2013-11-19 10:42:21	justinabrahms	but yes, I'd like to cache build deps between CI builds, which is separate from bundling full working copy of the website on a deploy.

2013-11-19 10:43:00	chrisdickinson	ah, i was suggesting that you could use browserify/module-deps to build a bundle (two bundles?) as part of the process, and ship one off to s3 for storage.
2013-11-19 10:43:10	chrisdickinson	but yeah, that runs into problems as well.
2013-11-19 10:43:45	chrisdickinson	it mostly came to mind because that's how requirebin works -- by caching built dep trees
2013-11-19 10:44:00	justinabrahms	right. I was hoping there was something I could do like:   gatherer --hashTarget="package.json" --outputDir="node_modules" --genCmd="npm install"
2013-11-19 10:44:33	chrisdickinson	oo
2013-11-19 10:44:36	chrisdickinson	actually
2013-11-19 10:44:46	chrisdickinson	do you have git in drone.io?
2013-11-19 10:44:48	justinabrahms	yes.
2013-11-19 10:44:53	justinabrahms	I have full access to an ubuntu system.
2013-11-19 10:44:57	chrisdickinson	does it do a full clone?
2013-11-19 10:45:00	justinabrahms	yes.
2013-11-19 10:45:06	justinabrahms	or rather I think it does.
2013-11-19 10:45:08	chrisdickinson	interesting
2013-11-19 10:45:12	justinabrahms	https://drone.io/github.com/justinabrahms/all-seeing-eye/19
2013-11-19 10:45:30	justinabrahms	https://drone.io/github.com/justinabrahms/all-seeing-eye/admin -- build script
2013-11-19 10:46:40	chrisdickinson	hmm
2013-11-19 10:47:33	justinabrahms	would expect that gatherer script to work something like: https://gist.github.com/justinabrahms/7311596  but make what to hash, what the output is and where to put it config vars.
2013-11-19 10:48:57	justinabrahms	if package.json isn't changed (validated by checking hash), we should be able to check out the cached bundle from s3, otherwise build it with genCmd, and store outputDir  with the hash.
2013-11-19 10:49:28	justinabrahms	but the trick is I don't want a dependency chain b/c i'd be in the same situation of having to setup an env all the time which is slow.
2013-11-19 10:49:45	justinabrahms	but this is mostly just splitting hairs b/c the build is still ~1 minute (though tests only take ~16ms)
2013-11-19 10:52:18	chrisdickinson	hmm
2013-11-19 10:52:50	chrisdickinson	wonder if you could get away from the s3 requirement by just tarballing the node_modules/ dir, adding that as a git blob object, and tagging the object
2013-11-19 10:53:27	justinabrahms	would likely get into a weird circular situation where git push triggers build which triggers git push.

2013-11-19 11:13:41	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: if it helps, `git hash-object <(npm ls 2>&1)` should give you a hash of just the the deps

I think it happened after installing node.js
2013-11-20 13:39:14	carriecarter	any idea how to get it back to my computer name/directory?
2013-11-20 13:42:00	jarofghosts	what shell are you using?

2013-11-20 13:43:03	carriecarter	it says bash in the window header... not sure. I'm very much a junior front end web developer, so not well versed in terminal other than basic git commands

2013-11-20 13:46:14	hackygolucky	I also felt like I could explore random music and find good stuff on Spotify.

2013-11-20 13:49:40	hackygolucky	othiym23: that's awesome! didn't know that.
2013-11-20 13:49:49	jarofghosts	i was wondering why your computers name wouldve changed
2013-11-20 13:50:22	carriecarter	well, at least now I know more about the terminal prompt than I did before!
2013-11-20 13:50:29	jarofghosts	!m carriecarter
2013-11-20 13:50:31	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work carriecarter!
2013-11-20 13:51:05	taterbase	<3 spotify, totally reinvented how I share and learn about new music
2013-11-20 13:51:44	jarofghosts	i loved spotify until they removed almost an entire album that i listened to a lot :/
2013-11-20 13:51:56	hackygolucky	taterbase: same here. It got me back into listening to a ton of new music.
2013-11-20 13:52:06	hackygolucky	jarofghosts: weird!
2013-11-20 13:52:08	taterbase	hackygolucky: yup that's the big one.
2013-11-20 13:52:16	jarofghosts	yeah its a bummer
2013-11-20 13:52:18	jarofghosts	i had it downloaded
2013-11-20 13:52:22	jarofghosts	but of course that doesnt matter
2013-11-20 13:52:27	hackygolucky	wha? that's horrible.
2013-11-20 13:52:39	taterbase	jarofghosts: I tend to supplement with purchasing actual albums.
2013-11-20 13:52:48	jarofghosts	this one is out of print
2013-11-20 13:52:53	taterbase	oh :(
2013-11-20 13:52:55	jarofghosts	or at least it was last i checked
2013-11-20 13:53:02	jarofghosts	i just switched over to google play music
2013-11-20 13:53:05	jarofghosts	well
2013-11-20 13:53:08	jarofghosts	i have both
2013-11-20 13:53:25	othiym23	jarofghosts: the labels are super irritating about that stuff
2013-11-20 13:53:42	jarofghosts	thats surprising considering its a small label
2013-11-20 13:53:47	jarofghosts	maybe they got bought out or something
2013-11-20 13:54:09	othiym23	Rhapsody and Google Music did a lot of stuff to try to mitigate that by substituting resubmissions of the same tracks under different ISRCs / UPCs, but catalogs change hands all the time
2013-11-20 13:54:50	othiym23	jarofghosts: it could be as simple as their DSP (the middleman organization that takes their stuff and submits it to the music services) changing rates or something
2013-11-20 13:55:03	jarofghosts	ah
2013-11-20 13:55:06	othiym23	or maybe they took their stuff down because Spotify's royalties to smaller labels are derisory
2013-11-20 13:55:16	jarofghosts	yeah im super uninformed about that whole industry
2013-11-20 13:56:02	jarofghosts	but it looks like they have the album available to download from the label's site
2013-11-20 13:56:23	jarofghosts	is spotify still terrible for adding your own music?
2013-11-20 13:56:30	taterbase	jarofghosts: no!
2013-11-20 13:56:38	taterbase	jarofghosts: I supplement often that way
2013-11-20 13:56:43	jarofghosts	as in if i import music can i listen to it on another device?

2013-11-20 13:57:01	hackygolucky	jarofghosts: you can if you use the paid version.
2013-11-20 13:57:04	taterbase	you might want Grooveshark :S
2013-11-20 13:57:07	hackygolucky	iirc

2013-11-20 13:57:32	jarofghosts	ha
2013-11-20 13:57:37	scottjab	what now?
2013-11-20 13:57:58	jarofghosts	spotify sucking less
2013-11-20 13:58:10	hackygolucky	scottjab: can you listen to your imported music on different devices if you paid for spotify?
2013-11-20 13:58:18	scottjab	yes
2013-11-20 13:58:26	taterbase	If Spotify's radio was actually good it would be perfect
2013-11-20 13:58:29	scottjab	but you have to plug your phone into your puter for it to sync
2013-11-20 13:58:39	jarofghosts	eh
2013-11-20 13:58:41	scottjab	I dont' really use radio in spotify or pandora
2013-11-20 13:58:57	jarofghosts	pretty sure google music just works
2013-11-20 13:59:06	jarofghosts	you import it and then its available wherever
2013-11-20 13:59:21	jarofghosts	but i also havent run into a situation where they didnt have something i was looking for
2013-11-20 14:00:16	hackygolucky	jarofghosts: the biggest problem I've run into with Google Music is that I've forgotten what I've imported from old music collections
2013-11-20 14:00:22	hackygolucky	so I'm bummed when something is missing.
2013-11-20 14:00:45	jarofghosts	is this with all access?
2013-11-20 14:00:48	jarofghosts	the paid version?
2013-11-20 14:00:51	hackygolucky	oh, that and you have to manually choose what you want to be able to listen to offline because phones have a limited capacity storage
2013-11-20 14:01:05	hackygolucky	oh, free.
2013-11-20 14:01:13	hackygolucky	always assume with me I'm using the free version
2013-11-20 14:01:15	hackygolucky	:)
2013-11-20 14:01:17	jarofghosts	haha
2013-11-20 14:01:26	hackygolucky	I'd rather listen to commercials than pay

2013-11-20 14:01:53	hackygolucky	hah
2013-11-20 14:01:58	jarofghosts	they had a deal where when it first came out they only charged $7.99/mo
2013-11-20 14:02:01	jarofghosts	so i got in on that
2013-11-20 14:02:05	jarofghosts	and its worth it to me
2013-11-20 14:02:16	jarofghosts	even now its only like $10
2013-11-20 14:02:19	jarofghosts	which isnt bad

2013-11-20 14:04:07	hackygolucky	booooo.
2013-11-20 14:04:09	Wraithan	my bot is a bunch of services
2013-11-20 14:04:15	Wraithan	so just write a service and I could run it
2013-11-20 14:04:26	hackygolucky	we'll have to chat about this.
2013-11-20 14:04:38	hackygolucky	I don't think I understand quite what you mean. Tomorrow night, perhaps?
2013-11-20 14:04:40	Wraithan	https://github.com/zenirc/zenircbot-motivate
2013-11-20 14:04:46	Wraithan	example of a service
2013-11-20 14:05:18	hackygolucky	I love the idea of writing a welcome back carter service.
2013-11-20 14:06:09	Wraithan	hackygolucky: I wouldn't run it
2013-11-20 14:06:24	Wraithan	but you could run an instance of zenircbot that does it, or you could add it to peeweebot
2013-11-20 14:07:15	Wraithan	I think things like that are obnoxious and only really funny the first time
2013-11-20 14:07:16	hackygolucky	peeweebot is very specifically supposed to imitate peewee herman. That wouldn't work. I get your point.
2013-11-20 14:07:48	hackygolucky	I think that all depends on how often carter exits and joins :)

2013-11-20 20:12:06	hitechbunny	Hey folks. I have a getting started question. I've tried googling for the answer but I've not found any answers. I'm following the http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/running_redis_service/ example. I get stuck with the same problem as I found in this gist: https://gist.github.com/edw/6308497 "E: Unable to locate package redis-server"

2013-11-26 13:24:54	hackygolucky	aaaand there's the whole, it is REALLY expensive thing.
2013-11-26 13:24:56	jden	not sure how that works.
2013-11-26 13:25:17	jden	it's super expensive - i can't afford to go this year. it's a lot of fun, though. i'd recommend it for anyone not in a position to pay for it personally
2013-11-26 13:25:18	__love__	i've been spoiled by pycon. i was floored at the jsconf ticket price
2013-11-26 13:25:44	hackygolucky	jden: I'm trying to plan out the confs I'd like to attend next year, and I just saw that the tickets go on sale for JSConf very soon.
2013-11-26 13:26:10	ericholscher	try and buy one, worst case you transfer it if you can't go
2013-11-26 13:26:23	hackygolucky	ericholscher: good point.
2013-11-26 13:26:31	ericholscher	holy wow, expense
2013-11-26 13:26:31	jden	on a related note, we need more node talks at osbridge next year
2013-11-26 13:26:47	hackygolucky	:-/
2013-11-26 13:26:54	hackygolucky	is osbridge the cheaper one?
2013-11-26 13:27:12	hackygolucky	the employees that went last year from our office made osbridge sound...uninteresting.
2013-11-26 13:27:54	jden	osbridge is the cheap one
2013-11-26 13:28:04	jden	it's super ecclectic!

2013-11-26 13:29:50	jden	hmm... the osbridge 2014 tickets are more expensive than i recall last year being

2013-11-26 13:31:53	jden	i mean, that's an appropriate ticket price for a conference. but it wouldn't be enough for it to stand out in my memory as "the cheap one"
2013-11-26 13:32:04	ericholscher	compared to oscon :)
2013-11-26 13:32:10	jden	i mean, nodepdx was less than that
2013-11-26 13:32:14	jden	ha, well, oscon...
2013-11-26 13:32:25	jden	oscon is basically redhat west, from what i've heard

2013-11-26 13:33:06	othiym23	I've still never been

2013-11-26 13:33:27	othiym23	and you'd have to pay *me* to go to OSCon

2013-11-26 13:33:59	jden	jk i paid 225 for osbridge last year
2013-11-26 13:34:16	hackygolucky	you can't even volunteer for OSCon and get in free
2013-11-26 13:34:22	hackygolucky	I think the volunteer rate was 300

2013-11-26 13:38:15	hackygolucky	yeah, I thought it was weird especially because the organizers certainly get along with the node crowd.

2013-11-26 13:43:24	ericholscher	it is odd that a company runs npm
2013-11-26 13:44:15	hackygolucky	they don't run it.
2013-11-26 13:44:46	ericholscher	We are Nodejitsu. We run the npm registry service for you.

2013-11-26 13:46:44	ericholscher	I'm not saying its bad, just odd -- I don't know of any other communities that are organized as such
2013-11-26 13:47:02	ericholscher	It's also rather odd that joyant has copyright over it

2013-11-26 13:49:05	ericholscher	ruby, perl, python are all copyright by the authors I believe?
2013-11-26 13:49:19	ericholscher	is there copyright assignment on the node code?
2013-11-26 13:49:50	chrisdickinson	there is a CLA for Node and its constituent parts
2013-11-26 13:49:55	chrisdickinson	but there's one for Python as well
2013-11-26 13:50:00	ericholscher	sure
2013-11-26 13:50:05	ericholscher	copyright assignment is a good thing in general

2013-11-26 13:50:20	s5fs	what--ever
2013-11-26 13:50:28	ericholscher	it allows you to actually change things down the line :)
2013-11-26 13:50:48	s5fs	if you don't like a cla, fork the project and do whatever
2013-11-26 13:50:49	hackygolucky	ericholscher: apologies. I think when you said 'run' I thought of it in a much different context. Either way, I was wrong.

2013-11-26 13:53:01	s5fs	that's the gist of a cla as i understand it

2013-11-26 15:48:10	othiym23	the problem is that we (by which I mean the Node community and the core team et al) don't have control over the language
2013-11-26 15:48:13	othiym23	Node isn't a language
2013-11-26 15:48:27	othiym23	it's a platform that uses a language controlled by other entities
2013-11-26 15:48:43	othiym23	which is why I don't really have much trouble with Joyent controlling the trademark for Node
2013-11-26 15:49:02	othiym23	the bits of Node we have control over are the core APIs and libuv
2013-11-26 15:49:25	othiym23	in that light, I'm not sure a Python Foundation-like entity makes sense

2013-11-26 15:51:24	hackygolucky	tc39 is an interesting concept.
2013-11-26 15:52:47	othiym23	well, TC39 is only one of the stakeholders
2013-11-26 15:53:12	othiym23	the larger, more important ones, as far as Node's concerned, are the Chromium and V8 teams
2013-11-26 15:53:27	jarofghosts	yuss
2013-11-26 15:53:38	othiym23	Ben and Trevor are having some luck arguing for Node's use cases to them right now, but in general we're a second-order consumer of their work, and take secondary precedence
2013-11-26 15:54:11	othiym23	our relationship there is essentially parasitic, or at best symbiotic
2013-11-26 15:56:09	jden	I don't really think control over the IP is high stakes, but npm is undeniably something that A) costs a lot of money, and B) is important to the community
2013-11-26 15:57:10	hackygolucky	yes, yes.

2013-11-27 12:48:17	simantel	Noob Backbone question: I have a function defined inside a method on a view - is the best way to access another method on that view to assign "this" to a local variable inside the first method, then call thisAsLocalVariable.otherMethod()? Is there another way to do it?

2013-11-27 12:57:10	hackygolucky	justinabrahms: ^^
2013-11-27 12:59:16	chrisdickinson	simantel: to preserve "this" inside the function?
2013-11-27 12:59:34	chrisdickinson	folks tend to use `var that = this`, `var self = this`, or `thatFunction.bind(this)`
2013-11-27 13:00:00	chrisdickinson	rather, `thatFunction = thatFunction.bind(this)` -- which will preserve the outer `this` into the inner function.
2013-11-27 13:00:13	chrisdickinson	i usually go the `var self = this` route, personally
2013-11-27 13:01:17	simantel	chrisdickinson: awesome, thanks!
2013-11-27 13:02:49	othiym23	I used to use .bind(this) but have discovered that it's both slow *and* inhibits the JIT optimizer because of closure creation overhead
2013-11-27 13:03:22	hackygolucky	othiym23: what to use instead?
2013-11-27 13:04:11	chrisdickinson	othiym23: yeah, any function that refers to non-local variables + arguments can't be inlined if the callsite doesn't also share that context, iirc
2013-11-27 13:05:53	chrisdickinson	that is to say, even if you go the `var self = this` route the resulting function can't be inlined ):

2013-11-27 13:12:29	justinabrahms	simantel: do you have an example?
2013-11-27 13:12:59	<--	indexzero (~indexzero@199.47.77.72) has quit (Quit: indexzero)
2013-11-27 13:13:45	simantel	justinabrahms: "var self = this" works great, I just wasn't sure if that was the accepted standard or if there were cleverer ways to go about it
2013-11-27 13:13:47	justinabrahms	If I understand what it is you're going for, we would normally use _.bind(myFn, this);
2013-11-27 13:15:42	simantel	justinabrahms: would I then have to do that for every function I define in a method?
2013-11-27 13:15:47	chrisdickinson	simantel:(thatFunction.bind is the native es5 variant of underscore's _.bind)
2013-11-27 13:16:21	justinabrahms	underscore's version works on non-es5 compatible browsers, though (including phantomjs)
2013-11-27 13:16:29	chrisdickinson	es5-shim :)
2013-11-27 13:16:40	justinabrahms	you choose your libs, I'll choose mine ;)
2013-11-27 13:17:24	chrisdickinson	yes yes, just wanted to give an option to simantel
2013-11-27 13:17:46	justinabrahms	simantel: that sounds right, yes. You can also investigate _.bindAll(this, fn1, fn2, ... fnN) if you find yourself doing it a lot, but I wouldn't expect there to be many of those at all.
2013-11-27 13:17:50	chrisdickinson	but yeah, you will have to do `bind` to preserve for every internal function, unless you go the `bindAll` route
2013-11-27 13:18:08	justinabrahms	In fact, I'd guess in our ~40k lines of backbone, that's probably not done more than a dozen or two times.
2013-11-27 13:18:43	justinabrahms	worth pointing out that by using backbone he's already opted into using underscore.
2013-11-27 13:19:04	simantel	justinabrahms: if I'm using a jquery function and want to pass in the "this" context, though, could I bind that? what would that look like?
2013-11-27 13:19:12	chrisdickinson	or if you're feeling really sassy, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
2013-11-27 13:19:26	justinabrahms	simantel: I don't understand the question, really...
2013-11-27 13:19:39	justinabrahms	$.ajax({..success: _.bind(fn, this) ..});  ?
2013-11-27 13:19:41	chrisdickinson	el.click(_.bind(this, function(ev) { })
2013-11-27 13:19:53	chrisdickinson	sorry, my args are backwards for underscore
2013-11-27 13:20:00	justinabrahms	that could work, but you shouldn't be using that in underscore land, imo.
2013-11-27 13:20:00	simantel	gotcha
2013-11-27 13:20:06	justinabrahms	you should be using the events hash.
2013-11-27 13:20:10	chrisdickinson	or el.click($.proxy(function() { }, this))
2013-11-27 13:20:38	justinabrahms	events: {'click .selector.for.elem', 'myMethodName'}
2013-11-27 13:20:53	simantel	well I'll definitely read more about _.bind, but I think for my needs right now I'm just going to use self
2013-11-27 13:21:27	simantel	thanks for enlightening me about all the options, though!
2013-11-27 13:21:44	justinabrahms	I've also seen "var that = this;" to counteract the "self is a reserved word" thing, just to throw another option into the pool.
2013-11-27 13:22:59	chrisdickinson	one thing i've found that helps with that route is to be very meticulous -- if you ever find yourself reassigning `this`, use the new variable consistently throughout your function (i.e., use `that|self` wherever you *were* using `this`)
2013-11-27 13:24:06	simantel	yeah, that makes sense - I'll definitely replace "this" throughout the method
2013-11-27 13:24:09	chrisdickinson	one minor benefit to the self/that route is that strange libraries, like jquery, often like giving you a meaningful `this` value inside of callbacks they accept (`this` in event handlers being the element the listener callback is bound to, for example) -- with `self`/`that` that remains viable, with the `bind` route (all flavors) that does not
2013-11-27 13:25:17	simantel	oh, interesting - I wouldn't have thought of that
2013-11-27 13:26:14	chrisdickinson	i don't rely on that behavior *too* often (dom event delegation often leaves you with a pretty boring `this` inside your handler + what I often really want in there is `ev.currentTarget`) -- but sometimes it comes up & it's handy to have a tool to work around it
2013-11-27 13:26:56	justinabrahms	hrm. I don't know that we do that at all in my project (rely on jquery's implicit this), or at least I can't think of anywhere.
2013-11-27 13:27:13	chrisdickinson	hilariously, it comes up a lot more with d3
2013-11-27 13:27:16	othiym23	hackygolucky: I use 'var self = this', which is slightly faster than using .bind(this) because it doesn't do all the extra stuff bind does
2013-11-27 13:27:22	othiym23	it still shoots the JIT in the head, though
2013-11-27 13:27:27	 *	chrisdickinson nods mournfully
2013-11-27 13:30:27	Maciek416	I wonder if jquery-like useful-this iterators will fall out of use
2013-11-27 13:31:02	chrisdickinson	simantel: bears mentioning if you weren't already aware, es6 paves over this issue with shorthand functions -- (x, y) => { return x + y } -- that preserve the `this` of their instantiating context
2013-11-27 13:31:13	chrisdickinson	(a la coffeescript's => function notation)
2013-11-27 13:31:25	chrisdickinson	Maciek416: oh I dearly hope so.
2013-11-27 13:31:44	justinabrahms	Is there a name for that, chrisdickinson? If not, I'd like to propose "yummy lambda"
2013-11-27 13:31:51	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-11-27 13:32:04	Maciek416	it'd be cool to have that as part of some confuse-me-less/mystery-reduction code style standard that libraries could adhere to
2013-11-27 13:32:12	chrisdickinson	unfortunately titled "arrow functions" already ):
2013-11-27 13:32:20	simantel	ooh, cool! I use coffeescript at work, but am using JS for this project mostly just to brush up on the real deal
2013-11-27 13:32:26	simantel	so that's exciting
2013-11-27 13:33:13	chrisdickinson	simantel: there are tools (traceur, narcissus, es6ify + browserify) that'll let you transpile es6 code ("yummy lambdas" and all) to es5, if you're already in a place where transpiling works for you
2013-11-27 13:35:09	chrisdickinson	wow: https://blog.andyet.com/2013/11/27/happy-thanksgiving

2013-11-27 13:42:01	othiym23	I've met, like, 2 people who use Meteor for anything real
2013-11-27 13:42:12	jden	othiym23: Meteor *better* have money left, after their huge raise
2013-11-27 13:42:21	othiym23	jden, justinabrahms: I believe both &yet and ^lift are bootstrapped
2013-11-27 13:42:34	justinabrahms	I wouldn't expect a venture backed consulting company.
2013-11-27 13:42:41	justinabrahms	makes no sense as the business doesn't scale well enough.

2013-11-27 13:43:09	othiym23	^lift is all evilpacket with a little help from Henrik, I think
2013-11-27 13:43:27	othiym23	there's clearly something in the water over Tri-City way
2013-11-27 13:43:44	jden	so i'm trying to figure out where the moneys coming from. i think othiym23 nailed it with the mining operation
2013-11-27 13:43:46	othiym23	aside from trace amounts of U238 and VX binary agents from Umatilla, of course

2013-11-27 13:49:23	chrisdickinson	othiym23: my pet theory is that &yet moved into an office with a money spigot that was left on
2013-11-27 13:49:46	chrisdickinson	"should we call the utilities and get this guy turned off?" "nah… nah. we'll let it run for a bit."

2013-12-02 16:46:41	othiym23	just rehearsed my Node Summit talk and didn't completely shit the bed
2013-12-02 16:46:45	 *	othiym23 has high standards
2013-12-02 16:47:12	othiym23	jden: so you're talking about having separate error lines for 4xx / 5xx, right?

2013-12-02 16:47:37	othiym23	the other agent nerds I talked to here didn't think that something like that existed in NR
2013-12-02 16:47:41	othiym23	is that something you've seen elsewhere?
2013-12-02 16:48:07	jden	not in NR
2013-12-02 16:48:16	jden	I've never really used NR except in the past week and a half
2013-12-02 16:48:36	<--	hayes (~mghayes@67.131.102.78) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2013-12-02 16:48:36	jden	the way this came up is I saw a big spike in errors and was afraid I fubard something in production
2013-12-02 16:48:43	jden	but it was just a bunch of failed login attempts
2013-12-02 16:48:56	othiym23	on a scale of "pretty blown away by awesomeness" to "mind melted by xtreeem greatness", how impressed were you?
2013-12-02 16:48:59	 *	othiym23 coughs
2013-12-02 16:49:17	jden	well, installation was dead simple :)
2013-12-02 16:49:29	jden	overall it's pretty handy, especially given the effort/results ratio
2013-12-02 16:49:50	jden	i'm one of those pesky NIH people who is never fully satisfied with off the shelf stuff, so I immediately started breaking it, but... :)
2013-12-02 16:49:52	othiym23	if you want to ignore routes, there's an API call you can use for that, and if you want to ignore particular HTTP status codes, you can do that via configuration
2013-12-02 16:50:26	othiym23	although the latter may have a bug that is presently going unfixed due to Node Summit preparations on the part of one the developers
2013-12-02 16:50:34	othiym23	I hear he's super lazy
2013-12-02 16:50:39	jden	I wish there were a way to configure severity for different error codes, ie 4xx=warn, 5xx=error
2013-12-02 16:50:53	jden	yeah, that guy...
2013-12-02 16:51:15	jden	I mean, I would still want to track error events
2013-12-02 16:51:29	othiym23	jden: I'll submit a roadmapper request for that, because I think that would be generally useful, but who knows what the product team will make of it
2013-12-02 16:51:42	jden	for example, it would be a good way of indirectly seeing if some new client code broke if the api starts getting a ton of 400s

2013-12-02 16:52:05	jden	but i don't want to get woken up for an error alert in the middle of the night for 400s
2013-12-02 16:52:21	othiym23	yeah, the error tracer is one of my favorite parts of the module, and I'd like to see how we can make it more useful
2013-12-02 16:53:23	jden	we use statsd for lots of misc. event tracing - failed logins are one of the things we were tracking with that
2013-12-02 16:53:40	jden	it's just nice to have all of your event streams in one place to be able to analyze and spot correlations
2013-12-02 16:53:48	jden	trends / patterns / whatever analysts do
2013-12-02 16:54:04	othiym23	yep yep
2013-12-02 16:54:30	othiym23	New Relic sits in a weird space because APM is a weird space
2013-12-02 16:54:39	othiym23	it's sorta operational but targeted at app developers more than sysadmins
2013-12-02 16:55:01	jden	when your whole engineering team is 4 people, everyone's both :)
2013-12-02 16:55:41	jden	also: right now we're using a different app name for each of our staging environments - is there a better way to do this?
2013-12-02 16:56:31	jden	it seems to be working pretty well, but as we add more of our services, the apps menu is going to get really crowded
2013-12-02 16:57:04	othiym23	so you can give your apps multiple names
2013-12-02 16:57:57	othiym23	if you're fine with them all having individual names, then you need do nothing
2013-12-02 16:58:42	othiym23	but if you want to have a virtual rollup app for all of your staging environments, just add another rollup name that's the same across all the staging environments (e.g. "staging")
2013-12-02 16:59:02	othiym23	make sure that app_name is an array in your configuration, and just add another string with the rollup name
2013-12-02 16:59:15	jden	ah - so you can make it an array? this is a key insight
2013-12-02 16:59:59	jden	we just copied the example config. i guess it does show an array, but we just have one key in there right now
2013-12-02 17:00:08	jden	thanks for the tip
2013-12-02 17:01:47	othiym23	there's all kinds of great stuff in the documentation, which was written by a very handsome and friendly and nice person who is also awesome
2013-12-02 17:10:00	jden	3cross-app tracing would be super awesome in node, nudge nudge

2013-12-02 17:10:41	othiym23	gotta get end-user monitoring / RUM working first, but yeah, it's coming
2013-12-02 17:10:54	othiym23	(cross-application tracing piggybacks on real user monitoring
2013-12-02 17:10:59	othiym23	)
2013-12-02 17:11:16	jden	does it depend on some sort of transactionid to correlate across systems?
2013-12-02 17:12:20	othiym23	yep, sure does
2013-12-02 17:12:34	jden	damn, i was hoping for some other sort of black magic
2013-12-02 17:12:38	othiym23	and that has to be passed down through the request stack to the client to work properly
2013-12-02 17:12:52	othiym23	that would be rad
2013-12-02 17:13:00	othiym23	that's not how it works, though ;)

2013-12-04 15:00:35	AWinterman	maybe I'm an idealist too, why is the trademark important?
2013-12-04 15:01:15	chrisdickinson	it'd be work to fork, but it's totally feasible to fork
2013-12-04 15:01:26	hackygolucky	I don't think I understand his statement. What does 'community would just make a new one' mean?
2013-12-04 15:01:32	AWinterman	fork from node.js -> link.js or something?
2013-12-04 15:01:35	hackygolucky	oh
2013-12-04 15:01:37	hackygolucky	ugh
2013-12-04 15:01:38	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: they'd fork node.js to no.js
2013-12-04 15:01:48	chrisdickinson	and come up with pentagon shaped logos :)
2013-12-04 15:01:48	AWinterman	hahahah
2013-12-04 15:01:49	hackygolucky	that's awful.
2013-12-04 15:01:57	AWinterman	or maybe yes.js
2013-12-04 15:01:57	hackygolucky	how often does that sort of thing survive?
2013-12-04 15:02:03	chrisdickinson	jenkins
2013-12-04 15:02:09	hackygolucky	yup
2013-12-04 15:02:09	chrisdickinson	if a thing is useful it tends to survive

2013-12-04 15:02:22	hackygolucky	I'll stop this dead horse thing.
2013-12-04 15:02:23	hackygolucky	but
2013-12-04 15:02:24	__love__	wouldn't edge.js make more sense?
2013-12-04 15:02:25	AWinterman	jenkins had that issue?
2013-12-04 15:02:25	hackygolucky	how about
2013-12-04 15:02:30	__love__	nodes and edges and all that

2013-12-04 15:02:58	hackygolucky	AWinterman: I believe oracle bought it
2013-12-04 15:03:00	chrisdickinson	haha, no, oracle happened

2013-12-04 15:04:34	chrisdickinson	oracle didn't say no
2013-12-04 15:04:43	chrisdickinson	they wanted it to go in a different direction than the community did

2013-12-05 13:17:27	adamdicarlo	chrisdickinson, i was running the plate test suite the other day and found the number of tests executed to be different every time...is that expected?
2013-12-05 13:23:36	JSON_voorhees	adamdicarlo: could some tests be holding up others with global state. I assume they would be run in different orders each time like in mocha
2013-12-05 13:23:59	 *	JSON_voorhees has never used plate so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2013-12-05 13:24:04	-->	mghayes (~mghayes@67.131.102.78) has joined #pdxnode
2013-12-05 13:25:31	adamdicarlo	JSON_voorhees, yeah, they could be run in different order, but the number of total tests (over several runs) varied by almost 80
2013-12-05 13:25:59	adamdicarlo	i can't imagine there would be some "generate a random number of tests" logic in the test suite...
2013-12-05 13:26:23	adamdicarlo	reminds me, i need to add ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ to `boom`
2013-12-05 13:30:13	chrisdickinson	adamdicarlo: there are a few that are making a random number of assertions through the loop
2013-12-05 13:30:35	chrisdickinson	rather, looping a random number of times
2013-12-05 13:30:56	chrisdickinson	it's the number of assertions
2013-12-05 13:31:16	chrisdickinson	so, if there's an assert in the loop, and the loop goes for (1 + Math.random() * 100) times (which is not ~great)
2013-12-05 13:33:00	adamdicarlo	chrisdickinson, ahh okay. right, it's the number of assertions that are reported, not tests strictly
2013-12-05 13:33:32	adamdicarlo	so random number of loops/assertions... in order to try to test more cases? or test cases in various orders?
2013-12-05 13:34:04	adamdicarlo	it does seem like that would hide any test bugs where assert.end() got called too soon when other asserts were waiting.
2013-12-05 13:34:07	justinabrahms	adamdicarlo: I am personally a strong -1 to random data in tests.
2013-12-05 13:34:18	justinabrahms	Things that fail should fail consistently.
2013-12-05 13:34:25	adamdicarlo	yeah, methinks they should be deterministic
2013-12-05 13:35:02	chrisdickinson	i'm ~ on random data. random data as plate is using it is ... wrong
2013-12-05 13:35:22	chrisdickinson	random data representing "any value" is fine so long as you're testing the other edge cases
2013-12-05 13:35:29	 *	adamdicarlo nods
2013-12-05 13:36:10	justinabrahms	I think the "any value" can just as easily be a constant.
2013-12-05 13:36:24	justinabrahms	Which doesn't have the downside of being non-deterministic.
2013-12-05 13:36:31	adamdicarlo	you can also loop through a bunch of values.
2013-12-05 13:36:41	adamdicarlo	but yeah, you need specific edge case tests either way
2013-12-05 13:37:15	adamdicarlo	and this kind of non-determinism is far less scary than the kinds of weirdness i see in complex drupal sites every day :)
2013-12-05 13:40:22	chrisdickinson	yeah, the tests for plate aren't exactly... the most modern :)

2013-12-05 15:22:50	dlmanning	jden: What gives?
2013-12-05 15:23:00	hackygolucky	I observe how people behave around others. And act accordingly.

2013-12-05 15:34:07	AWinterman	yeah, I mean you can choose to do whatever you want when you speak
2013-12-05 15:34:18	AWinterman	it's your stage. If you want to put money into it go ahead
2013-12-05 15:34:25	AWinterman	it's not expected
2013-12-05 15:35:18	phated	entertaining and educating should be on the same level, not 1st and 2nd
2013-12-05 15:36:35	phated	paying for artwork is all well and good, but screw doing it for every talk or having the conf cover it
2013-12-05 15:38:45	hackygolucky	ahahaha
2013-12-05 15:38:57	hackygolucky	phated: I saw your tweet before your irc response.
2013-12-05 15:39:01	hackygolucky	:P
2013-12-05 15:39:24	hackygolucky	yeah I think I actually disagreed with -every- bullet point he wrote.
2013-12-05 15:39:33	phated	i want a lana cain picture to respond with
2013-12-05 15:39:38	hackygolucky	but he is coming from a much different perspective than I
2013-12-05 15:40:44	phated	http://mlkshk.com/r/DN2B
2013-12-05 15:40:51	Wraithan	hackygolucky: isn't the first time that I disagreed with pretty much everything eran said in a post
2013-12-05 15:40:54	Wraithan	smart dude
2013-12-05 15:41:02	Wraithan	I just have a different outlook on life than him
2013-12-05 15:42:11	hackygolucky	Wraithan: that is a great perspective. Especially because I think I agree.
2013-12-05 15:42:12	hackygolucky	I can imagine after ALL the talks he's attended and given, he might be a bit jaded.
2013-12-05 15:42:50	Wraithan	possible
2013-12-05 15:42:54	justinabrahms	I strongly disagreed with the first point "talks should be entertaining first, educational second" and stopped reading
2013-12-05 15:42:55	Wraithan	and I have liked some of his talks
2013-12-05 15:43:07	phated	justinabrahms: same
2013-12-05 15:43:35	hackygolucky	I dig the notion of pushing speakers to think beyond slides and talk points.
2013-12-05 15:44:03	phated	hackygolucky: spending money isn't required for that :/
2013-12-05 15:44:11	hackygolucky	You'll help create better presentations and cooler experiences. But I don't know if setting an extra budget for that...
2013-12-05 15:44:14	hackygolucky	phated: exactly.
2013-12-05 15:45:09	justinabrahms	If I think about what was described at node summer camp, that sounds super cool and doesn't require additional money beyond normal conference stuff.
2013-12-05 15:45:49	hackygolucky	justinabrahms: well, there was a SERIOUS budget for the nodebots workshop
2013-12-05 15:45:51	dlmanning	It's also going to discourage newer people from trying to give talks if they feel they need to put on a show
2013-12-05 15:45:53	hackygolucky	but that wasn't on the speakers
2013-12-05 15:46:10	hackygolucky	that was mikael working with the workshop runners to get the best kits for what they wanted to do
2013-12-05 15:48:43	phated	my problem is setting a standard 300-500 to spend
2013-12-05 15:48:58	phated	tons of people make perfectly amazing slides and presentations without it
2013-12-05 15:49:04	 *	Wraithan looks at chrisdickinson
2013-12-05 15:49:07	Wraithan	definitely
2013-12-05 15:49:14	phated	if it is a special case, use your own money or talk to the organizers
2013-12-05 15:49:24	phated	don't write blog posts demanding it
2013-12-05 15:49:24	Wraithan	And make me feel a bit ashamed of my own slides

2013-12-05 15:49:34	Wraithan	phated: I agree on all those points
2013-12-05 15:50:05	Wraithan	for example, if I wanted to build a cool robot demo for nodebots day, I'd ask for sponsorship money to build it, with the understanding that the org would get to keep the results
2013-12-05 15:52:06	JSON_voorhees	i like food tho
2013-12-05 15:52:16	JSON_voorhees	you guys don't like food
2013-12-05 15:52:20	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: aw shucks
2013-12-05 15:52:28	JSON_voorhees	I want a talk to be educational
2013-12-05 15:52:48	dlmanning	+1 educational
2013-12-05 15:52:50	JSON_voorhees	I don't pay hundreds of dollars to be entertained
2013-12-05 15:52:55	phated	JSON_voorhees: how does money translate to more educational
2013-12-05 15:53:02	dlmanning	If I want entertainment I'll go to the movies
2013-12-05 15:53:09	dlmanning	Or I go out clubbing with JSON_voorhees
2013-12-05 15:53:19	JSON_voorhees	phated: as in paying for conferences
2013-12-05 15:53:27	JSON_voorhees	which are expensive
2013-12-05 15:53:28	chrisdickinson	i'd rather talks be inspirational than educational, i think
2013-12-05 15:53:33	chrisdickinson	or, maybe a 70/30 mix
2013-12-05 15:54:06	phated	JSON_voorhees: i mean, how does giving a presenter $300-500 translate to a more educational talk?
2013-12-05 15:54:07	chrisdickinson	at least, the ones i've found i enjoy the most inspire me to go learn more about the topic by showing me a high level and then telling me why it's powerful
2013-12-05 15:54:17	phated	couldn't that money be used in other areas that would add education?
2013-12-05 15:54:23	JSON_voorhees	phated: for sure
2013-12-05 15:54:42	JSON_voorhees	I meant I don't pay hundreds of dollars for a conference ticket to be entertained
2013-12-05 15:54:52	JSON_voorhees	I want to learn something
2013-12-05 15:54:56	Wraithan	same
2013-12-05 15:54:59	phated	JSON_voorhees: exactly
2013-12-05 15:55:01	JSON_voorhees	If I get both that's dope
2013-12-05 15:55:10	Wraithan	If I want to be entertained, I'll pay 20 bucks for a show
2013-12-05 15:55:32	Wraithan	or like 4 bucks at a beer theater for a movie

2013-12-05 17:04:34	othiym23	for the record, I have never not learned a ton from an Eran Hammer talk
2013-12-05 17:04:37	othiym23	even RTconf
2013-12-05 17:04:51	othiym23	and his talks are also the most consistently entertaining ones I've seen
2013-12-05 17:05:07	othiym23	but he has a ton of natural charisma and energy that is maybe a bit much to expect from other speakers
2013-12-05 17:05:11	phated	so he is achieving his stated goals
2013-12-05 17:05:23	othiym23	I was super proud when he told me my talk had lots of good jokes in it
2013-12-05 17:05:26	othiym23	high praise from Eran
2013-12-05 17:06:06	othiym23	also I got my Manresa cookbook (thanks indexzero!) this week and it is mind-melting
2013-12-05 17:06:23	othiym23	I personally agree with Eran, and think that for a talk to succeed at educating it has to first entertain
2013-12-05 17:06:36	othiym23	or at least you have to be aware of the need to have entertainment value in your presentation
2013-12-05 17:06:56	othiym23	it's really hard to hold people's attention and receptive / reactive minds otherwise
2013-12-05 17:06:57	phated	hmm, i would say those are 2 different things
2013-12-05 17:07:26	phated	yes entertain, but not first above all else
2013-12-05 17:07:35	phated	keep it in your mind while crafting your talk
2013-12-05 17:07:38	othiym23	I feel like people have gotten a lot more value out of the talks I've given where I've made a conscious effort to be entertaining
2013-12-05 17:08:07	phated	being conscious of something doesn't mean it has to be your #1 priority
2013-12-05 17:08:30	othiym23	well, let me put it this way: I think if you emphasize the two things in that order, it's a lot easier to come out of a presentation with a more energized and attentive audience
2013-12-05 17:10:38	othiym23	jden: I have approximately 1e18 things to get through in the next week for work, but as the year winds down, I definitely want to pick up the thread of meetups again
2013-12-05 17:10:48	othiym23	I did a ton of networking to that effect at Node Summit
2013-12-05 17:11:08	othiym23	started talking this stuff over with Emily Tanaka-Delgado, too, who it turns out has a lot of opinions about these things
2013-12-05 17:11:16	othiym23	I like her she is smart and helpful

2013-12-06 10:49:31	Wraithan	multiline splits on lines and runs it once per line, right?
2013-12-06 10:49:46	Wraithan	or maybe nto
2013-12-06 10:50:21	donpdonp	oh i thought /m would treat the input as one long line

2013-12-06 10:50:48	donpdonp	:)
2013-12-06 10:51:00	Wraithan	multiline; treat beginning and end characters (^ and $) as working over multiple lines (i.e., match the beginning or end of each line (delimited by \n or \r), not only the very beginning or end of the whole input string)
2013-12-06 10:51:01	Wraithan	yea
2013-12-06 10:51:04	donpdonp	at any rate, whatever flags, i want to match everything

2013-12-06 10:51:21	donpdonp	no flags produces the same result
2013-12-06 10:51:30	donpdonp	oh /m only affects ^ and $

2013-12-06 11:46:18	chrisdickinson	pronounced out loud i'm fine with k-node or "kuh-node"
2013-12-06 11:46:30	chrisdickinson	the idea behind knode was originally to document different approaches to node / catalog modules folks use and their upsides / downsides, do author interviews, etc
2013-12-06 11:46:49	hackygolucky	which I still think is wonderful.
2013-12-06 11:46:54	chrisdickinson	i lean towards "kuh-node"

2013-12-06 11:51:27	othiym23	the idea of "Apache Node.js" makes me want to cry / barf

2013-12-06 11:51:52	hackygolucky	it's like they purposefully want the idea to be turned down.
2013-12-06 11:52:03	hackygolucky	horrible example.

2013-12-06 11:53:38	othiym23	my coworker and I were discussing the potential relicensing of Node yesterday, and he had an immediate and visceral reaction to the idea of putting Node under the GPL

2013-12-06 11:55:27	hackygolucky	othiym23: yeah, tbh I flagged down some python friends to talk about the DSF and PSF
2013-12-06 11:55:50	justinabrahms	I have an article partially written on that topic.
2013-12-06 11:55:58	hackygolucky	they said the money quotes that are being thrown around are outrageously off unless they are including having to buy ownership from Joyent
2013-12-06 11:56:11	hackygolucky	but that the problem is absolutely in maintaing the NPO
2013-12-06 11:56:14	hackygolucky	which I understand.
2013-12-06 11:56:39	justinabrahms	My article is of the topic: as a user of python, this is what I see the PSF/DSF doing outwardly.
2013-12-06 11:57:12	hackygolucky	othiym23: but that is also to say, I completely understand that they guys I was arguing with have previously looked at some of these options.
2013-12-06 11:59:13	hackygolucky	They have healthy perspectives, I just wonder if Joyent having a vested stake in it(no matter how benign they are) makes them less objective.
2013-12-06 11:59:22	hackygolucky	That's me being really untrusting of private entities.
2013-12-06 11:59:27	hackygolucky	So that's me projecting on Joyent.
2013-12-06 12:01:35	othiym23	I'm compromised, because I'm friends with the majority of the Joyent technical team at this point, and also Emily T-D and Ben Wen and Jim Farrell and a bunch of other people there
2013-12-06 12:01:54	othiym23	but I've also been hanging out in #libuv daily for months now, and have been around Node a little while in general
2013-12-06 12:02:09	othiym23	and I really don't see Joyent doing much to alter the direction of the project
2013-12-06 12:02:30	othiym23	a lot of the concerns I see articulated are speculative and expressed in the subjunctive mood
2013-12-06 12:02:54	othiym23	which isn't to say that they're unreasonable, just that they're not actually based on present-day fact
2013-12-06 12:03:30	Wraithan	hackygolucky: chumod is how I say it
2013-12-06 12:03:39	Wraithan	in my head at least
2013-12-06 12:04:14	othiym23	I like to get that glottal stop in there: ch'mod
2013-12-06 12:06:55	chrisdickinson	^^ same here
2013-12-06 12:07:44	hackygolucky	othiym23: right, they are all based on paranoia.
2013-12-06 12:07:48	hackygolucky	well, not all.
2013-12-06 12:08:00	chrisdickinson	i'd be lying if i discounted the role the giant "chown" sign visible outside the window of UA's old offices played in convincing me to move to portland
2013-12-06 12:08:31	hackygolucky	There are times where the arguments in public very much end up looking like company employees getting snarky with each other.
2013-12-06 12:08:38	hackygolucky	It's hard to keep that separate.
2013-12-06 12:09:20	hackygolucky	Sometimes SF seems like a very small place :P
2013-12-06 12:09:28	othiym23	Bryan Cantrill is basically a big kid with a big heart and an even bigger mouth
2013-12-06 12:09:40	othiym23	which sometimes overflows into being a bomb-throwing asshole
2013-12-06 12:10:02	othiym23	Issac Roth... well, I haven't really figured him out, but at the least he doesn't seem to have a good handle on how to talk to primarily technical people about non-technical things
2013-12-06 12:10:16	othiym23	and SF is indeed very small

2013-12-06 13:04:58	jden	ftr, I'm pro-foundation and share skepticism of profit-seeking entities. look, even MSFT spun out their open source stuff to a separate entity
2013-12-06 13:05:29	 *	hackygolucky nods
2013-12-06 13:05:55	hackygolucky	I'm totally find continuing the conversation. I'm certainly frustrated as it stands but not going anywhere.
2013-12-06 13:06:32	hackygolucky	jden: I figure we at least give perspective so they're aware that not everyone agrees
2013-12-06 13:07:07	hackygolucky	and by continuing I mean being that person who may not agree with everyone at the table over the long run. I love me a good debate.
2013-12-06 13:11:25	jden	hackygolucky: did you read http://blog.izs.me/post/69091089622/the-hazards-of-consensus
2013-12-06 13:11:45	hackygolucky	I did.
2013-12-06 13:12:01	hackygolucky	I'm surprised at how often I disagree with things both izs and mikael write.
2013-12-06 13:12:03	jden	this is very consistent with what i've heard repeatedly from isaacs. he put it really well in his jsconfAR talk, too
2013-12-06 13:12:34	hackygolucky	It... still seems to come from a place of privilege.
2013-12-06 13:13:25	hackygolucky	but yes, overall, it is beautiful for us to disagree and coexist. To still enjoy each other's company.

2013-12-06 13:14:50	hackygolucky	yup yup.
2013-12-06 13:14:52	jden	the flip side of this approach is that most of npm is just reimplementing the same things over and over
2013-12-06 13:14:59	hackygolucky	hah
2013-12-06 13:15:05	jden	and there's *value* in that, for the implementers, mainly
2013-12-06 13:15:06	hackygolucky	says every programmer in our office who doesn't node.
2013-12-06 13:15:18	jden	it's an awesome playground to learn in
2013-12-06 13:15:19	 *	hackygolucky nods
2013-12-06 13:15:32	jden	but it's not good overall for building bigger things
2013-12-06 13:15:32	hackygolucky	as a newbie, I have no problem reinventing the wheel.
2013-12-06 13:15:37	hackygolucky	So long as I get to keep my job
2013-12-06 13:15:37	jden	same
2013-12-06 13:15:44	hackygolucky	right.
2013-12-06 13:15:56	hackygolucky	and that's a hard sell for node getting older.
2013-12-06 13:16:26	hackygolucky	I was suprised on the ML how visceral the reaction was to 'large companies could steer away from node because of X'
2013-12-06 13:16:43	hackygolucky	and how people like izs sounded very arrogant because there are some large companies who do use node
2013-12-06 13:17:14	hackygolucky	yes, it is awesome the adoption we are seeing. No, let's not be naiive that everything is good.
2013-12-06 13:17:56	jden	i would, for example, be scared shitless to fly on a plane powered by node
2013-12-06 13:18:10	hackygolucky	hah
2013-12-06 13:19:15	jden	i still think node is the best community for new programmers, however.
2013-12-06 13:19:18	hackygolucky	I just think we've jumped the gun on the cockiness
2013-12-06 13:19:23	jden	definitely
2013-12-06 13:19:23	hackygolucky	yup
2013-12-06 13:19:24	hackygolucky	yes
2013-12-06 13:19:28	hackygolucky	definitely.
2013-12-06 13:19:40	 *	jden agreefest
2013-12-06 13:20:05	jden	in the next year, I *need* to branch out to another language, though. javascript is driving me batty
2013-12-06 13:20:22	justinabrahms	jden: erlang?
2013-12-06 13:20:34	othiym23	jden: F#!
2013-12-06 13:20:38	jden	justinabrahms: possibly.
2013-12-06 13:20:40	justinabrahms	Lots of cool concepts in erlang w/r/t distributed systems.
2013-12-06 13:20:41	hackygolucky	jden: I wish I was in that place. I have a little while longer.
2013-12-06 13:20:58	othiym23	although I really want to spend more time with Clojure again soon
2013-12-06 13:21:00	jden	erlang and F# both have the same problem of having corporate sponsors, though
2013-12-06 13:21:06	adamdicarlo	jden: haskell is pretty sweet.
2013-12-06 13:21:08	jden	maybe ocaml?
2013-12-06 13:21:10	othiym23	Clojure really speaks to me in a way that most newer languages haven't
2013-12-06 13:21:12	hackygolucky	I may dive back into python more after javascript. or C++
2013-12-06 13:21:30	justinabrahms	C++++
2013-12-06 13:21:47	jden	F# has typesafe numerica units, which is *awesome*
2013-12-06 13:21:49	justinabrahms	I've always meant to play with C++ & friends, but have never found the time.
2013-12-06 13:21:53	othiym23	jden: F# is basically Ocaml with a community
2013-12-06 13:21:55	adamdicarlo	C++++ is C#...that's where they got the name
2013-12-06 13:21:56	justinabrahms	I've just been playing in go instead.

2013-12-06 13:22:11	adamdicarlo	oh
2013-12-06 13:22:12	othiym23	I love Ocaml to bits, wrote it for years for my own projects, but it's a bear to get running and keep running the toolchain

2013-12-06 13:28:24	nvcexploder	on node up right now though
2013-12-06 13:28:36	othiym23	the Node Summity bits were productive enough, given the target audience
2013-12-06 13:28:44	hackygolucky	oh shoot.  yeah
2013-12-06 13:28:54	othiym23	everything else was massively exhausting and probably good long-term but surprisingly emotional
2013-12-06 13:28:58	othiym23	I was wiped out after it was over
2013-12-06 13:29:12	hackygolucky	emotional?
2013-12-06 13:29:27	othiym23	and also it was no NodeConf / NodePDX / etc
2013-12-06 13:30:01	hackygolucky	I will say, I was amazed by the companies presenting and that they were all using node in significant ways.
2013-12-06 13:30:24	othiym23	hackygolucky: hallway track was pretty much consumed with gossip and drama llama wrangling

2013-12-09 14:08:20	Wraithan	s5fs: the warmup is complex, but mostly because he jsut wants to hit the whole body each day in a slight way
2013-12-09 14:08:54	Wraithan	s5fs: the workout itself targets some issues I have, like a shoulder that needs to be strengthened, and core strength because I sit around all day, etc

2013-12-09 16:37:32	othiym23	although it'd actually be easier to port Scala to transpile to JS than Haskell, because of all the explicit type annotations required to deal with type erasure

2013-12-09 17:43:49	JSON_voorhees	othiym23: I really want to spend some time with clojure and clojurescript
2013-12-09 17:44:18	JSON_voorhees	there is a particuliar project I am just dying to play with https://github.com/overtone/overtone
2013-12-09 17:44:59	JSON_voorhees	I don't really wanna switch my inferior lisp mode in emacs though. it's currently set up for CL
2013-12-09 17:45:23	JSON_voorhees	but I just need to write a function that will switch all that for me
2013-12-09 17:46:18	JSON_voorhees	I also know setting up the environment will be a bit of a time suck as I've never done anything with java stuff outside of eclipse
2013-12-09 17:46:30	JSON_voorhees	Though the docs are all pretty straight forward
2013-12-09 17:47:28	nvcexploder	JSON_voorhees: rad!
2013-12-09 17:47:29	justinabrahms	I played around with clojurescript a bit. I'd be willing to spend more time with it on a different project. I don't think a chrome extension was the best place to start, as there is just too much external API integration which is a little wonky.
2013-12-09 17:47:29	dlmanning	Is there like, a coffeescript for clojure?
2013-12-09 17:47:30	justinabrahms	use lein and your life will be reasonable.
2013-12-09 17:47:30	nvcexploder	just about to say that
2013-12-09 17:47:31	nvcexploder	http://leiningen.org/
2013-12-09 17:47:31	dlmanning	Cause I heard that coffeescript is for closures
2013-12-09 17:48:25	JSON_voorhees	nvcexploder: you have much experience with either?
2013-12-09 17:48:38	nvcexploder	leon and clojure? yeah!
2013-12-09 17:48:40	nvcexploder	lein
2013-12-09 17:48:44	nvcexploder	stupid autocorrect.
2013-12-09 17:48:49	 *	dlmanning is stretching for a Glengarry Glen Ross reference
2013-12-09 17:48:53	nvcexploder	heh
2013-12-09 17:48:58	justinabrahms	nvcexploder: have you ever met phil, the author? He's an awesome guy.
2013-12-09 17:49:24	justinabrahms	dlmanning: Well, nice try. Here's a set of steak knives.
2013-12-09 17:49:50	dlmanning	thanks, I'll show myself out
2013-12-09 17:49:50	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: nope
2013-12-09 17:49:57	nvcexploder	justinabrahms: is he in PDX?
2013-12-09 17:50:12	justinabrahms	nvcexploder: SEA
2013-12-09 17:50:18	nvcexploder	cool
2013-12-09 17:50:20	justinabrahms	he runs seajure (clojure group in seattle)
2013-12-09 17:50:25	JSON_voorhees	justinabrahms: author of clojurescript?
2013-12-09 17:50:28	nvcexploder	HA
2013-12-09 17:50:31	JSON_voorhees	or lein?
2013-12-09 17:53:11	justinabrahms	JSON_voorhees: no, lein.

2013-12-10 11:32:13	jden	yeah, thoward57 showed it to me earlier this year and it's always been one of those things in the back of my mind to check out

2013-12-10 11:33:44	justinabrahms	jden: what's the import syntax?
2013-12-10 11:34:11	justinabrahms	`require foo` or `from x require y`? and if `require foo` do you have to use `foo.ExportedThing` or just `ExportedThing`?

2013-12-10 13:51:27	jarofghosts	so i wouldnt derive any truth from it
2013-12-10 13:51:35	jarofghosts	because i just speculated and joked about it?
2013-12-10 13:51:43	ericholscher	right, but it could be totally true
2013-12-10 13:51:53	jarofghosts	i would be hesitant to claim knowledge of their motives without speaking to them
2013-12-10 13:51:56	jarofghosts	it could!
2013-12-10 13:52:00	CloJerk	they're just having fun period
2013-12-10 13:52:01	jarofghosts	and also could not
2013-12-10 13:52:01	ericholscher	i still haven't heard a good reason to call it that, if it isn't meant to be offputting to newcomers?
2013-12-10 13:52:05	jarofghosts	that was my point
2013-12-10 13:52:24	jarofghosts	how is it offputting to other people to call yourself a jerk?
2013-12-10 13:52:44	ericholscher	because if you self-identify as a jerk, I don't want to come to your meetup as a beginner
2013-12-10 13:52:49	ericholscher	because you will be a jerk to me..
2013-12-10 13:53:21	jarofghosts	would you not join the PIG group either?
2013-12-10 13:53:23	AWinterman_	ericholscher: I think it's meant to be light hearted and ironic
2013-12-10 13:53:31	jarofghosts	because they would likely eat all of your food and roll around in slop?
2013-12-10 13:53:33	ericholscher	that makes it okay then
2013-12-10 13:53:55	AWinterman_	maybe poking fun at the tech communities tendency to gravitate to whatever's new and sexy
2013-12-10 13:53:56	AWinterman_	or something
2013-12-10 13:54:00	ericholscher	because i know the intentions behind the naming when I am a beginner deciding to get involved
2013-12-10 13:54:29	ericholscher	jarofghosts: not sure, but jerk is obviously bad
2013-12-10 13:54:39	AWinterman_	I think it might be unreasonable to make a fuss about the word "jerk"
2013-12-10 13:55:00	CloJerk	I agree
2013-12-10 13:55:13	ericholscher	i think it might be unreasonable to defend the use of the word jerk, because its "light hearted and ironic"
2013-12-10 13:55:18	jarofghosts	its free publicity, though
2013-12-10 13:55:21	AWinterman_	especially because you get to say clojure when you say the name of the title
2013-12-10 13:55:24	AWinterman_	group
2013-12-10 13:55:25	AWinterman_	etc.
2013-12-10 13:55:32	jarofghosts	im not sure jerk is all that offensive of a term
2013-12-10 13:55:36	jarofghosts	unless this is suddenly 1910
2013-12-10 13:55:40	AWinterman_	^^
2013-12-10 13:55:42	ericholscher	what?
2013-12-10 13:55:49	ericholscher	what does it mean then?
2013-12-10 13:55:54	AWinterman_	jerk means a meanie
2013-12-10 13:55:55	jarofghosts	if i made a group called the rapscallions
2013-12-10 13:56:05	ericholscher	jerk is still obviously in common usage
2013-12-10 13:56:07	jarofghosts	or possibly the ragamuffins
2013-12-10 13:56:07	CloJerk	i would go to that jarofghosts 
2013-12-10 13:56:14	AWinterman_	clojurese
2013-12-10 13:56:15	jarofghosts	sweet
2013-12-10 13:56:16	AWinterman_	clojurn
2013-12-10 13:56:20	AWinterman_	clojourney
2013-12-10 13:56:24	ericholscher	your defense is the problem with the programming community, FYI
2013-12-10 13:56:24	<--	benedmunds (~textual@75-164-228-176.ptld.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2013-12-10 13:56:35	jarofghosts	were going to bust rhymes about onions
2013-12-10 13:56:38	AWinterman_	I mean, the defense is problematic for more serious topics
2013-12-10 13:56:42	jarofghosts	at rapscallions meetup
2013-12-10 13:56:43	AWinterman_	and more serious slurs
2013-12-10 13:57:00	AWinterman_	jerk is gender/class/race nuetral unless I need a lesson in etymology
2013-12-10 13:57:08	ericholscher	but its anti-beginner
2013-12-10 13:57:15	ericholscher	so it is gender biased
2013-12-10 13:57:19	AWinterman_	uh....
2013-12-10 13:57:22	jarofghosts	wait
2013-12-10 13:57:24	CloJerk	clojure elite would be anti-beginner
2013-12-10 13:57:24	jarofghosts	WHAT
2013-12-10 13:57:47	ericholscher	perpetuating the status quo is keeping things male and white
2013-12-10 13:57:58	CloJerk	that makes absolutely no sense
2013-12-10 13:58:01	jarofghosts	this is how socratic irony works
2013-12-10 13:58:09	AWinterman_	!M jarofghosts
2013-12-10 13:58:09	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work jarofghosts!
2013-12-10 13:58:20	ericholscher	so the status quo isn't male and white?
2013-12-10 13:58:47	CloJerk	the status quo of the country is male and white
2013-12-10 13:58:50	hackygolucky	I feel like this argument is coming off a bit simplified, but I agree with you ericholscher
2013-12-10 13:58:58	ericholscher	and you're arguing that nobody would be offput by going to a meetup with people who self-describe at "jerks"?
2013-12-10 13:59:02	AWinterman_	so... I think the issue is that saying anything that is anti-beginner is anti-women -> women are beginners kind of fast
2013-12-10 13:59:09	jarofghosts	right
2013-12-10 13:59:17	hackygolucky	it's the old notion of programmers being jerks being an acceptable behavior.
2013-12-10 13:59:20	ericholscher	its not that women are beginners, its that the status quo is white and male
2013-12-10 13:59:31	ericholscher	so being anti-beginner is supporting the white and male status quo
2013-12-10 13:59:32	jarofghosts	[13:57:08] <ericholscher>	 but its anti-beginner
2013-12-10 13:59:32	jarofghosts	[13:57:15] <ericholscher>	 so it is gender biased
2013-12-10 13:59:40	hackygolucky	well yes
2013-12-10 13:59:41	ericholscher	right, in context
2013-12-10 13:59:51	hackygolucky	because women in programming is at its peak, 20%
2013-12-10 13:59:54	--	You are now known as JSON_voorhees
2013-12-10 13:59:59	hackygolucky	there is a huge surge of newer programmers being women
2013-12-10 14:00:00	AWinterman_	hackygolucky: yeah, what a sad state
2013-12-10 14:00:12	hackygolucky	so at this point, anti-beginner is anti-women
2013-12-10 14:00:18	hackygolucky	by happenstance
2013-12-10 14:00:23	jarofghosts	i know plenty of women who are not at all beginners
2013-12-10 14:00:27	hackygolucky	absolutely
2013-12-10 14:00:28	JSON_voorhees	who is anti-beginners?
2013-12-10 14:00:35	ericholscher	jerks
2013-12-10 14:00:42	hackygolucky	there are many awesome experienced female programemrs
2013-12-10 14:00:46	hackygolucky	blegh.
2013-12-10 14:00:49	hackygolucky	spelling.
2013-12-10 14:00:50	JSON_voorhees	I don't see the logic in that
2013-12-10 14:00:51	jarofghosts	so its kind of dangerous to group everything into such a broad category
2013-12-10 14:01:27	AWinterman_	I also think many other things, apart from the name of the group, influence whether or not it's beginner friendly
2013-12-10 14:01:43	jden	JSON_voorhees: can you clarify the antecedant?
2013-12-10 14:02:17	hackygolucky	jarofghosts: yes, we have made a horrible case of this.
2013-12-10 14:02:31	jarofghosts	yeah, im not trying to be argumentative
2013-12-10 14:02:37	hackygolucky	oh no, you're fine.
2013-12-10 14:02:43	jarofghosts	just illustrate how dangerous it is to go down a path like that
2013-12-10 14:02:47	 *	hackygolucky nods
2013-12-10 14:02:54	ericholscher	my points: Having a group that is a bunch of jerks is anti-beginner, and since the status quo is white and male, being anti-beginner is perpetuating the status quo -- agree or disagree?
2013-12-10 14:02:56	jarofghosts	notice how immediately everything fell apart
2013-12-10 14:03:08	AWinterman_	I think forming an open community and making outreach into beginner demographics is much more important than your name
2013-12-10 14:03:10	jarofghosts	the group isnt jerks, they just call themselves jerks
2013-12-10 14:03:10	JSON_voorhees	jden: cloJerks may be offputting to beginners, a lot of women are beginners. so jerks is not gender-biased
2013-12-10 14:03:14	AWinterman_	and you can spin the brand how you want
2013-12-10 14:03:46	JSON_voorhees	I call myself meandave on twitter, is that anti-beginner?
2013-12-10 14:03:51	JSON_voorhees	Im a beginner
2013-12-10 14:04:03	ericholscher	maybe
2013-12-10 14:04:11	ericholscher	but thats not what i'm talking about
2013-12-10 14:04:15	jden	it's certainly anti-dave
2013-12-10 14:04:20	jarofghosts	!m jden
2013-12-10 14:04:21	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work jden!
2013-12-10 14:04:56	ericholscher	in this specific instance I think calling your group clojerks is a bad idea, and I don't see how you can defend it
2013-12-10 14:05:11	ericholscher	"its just a joke" is a horrible defense
2013-12-10 14:05:20	jarofghosts	and i think the problem is that you dont see how
2013-12-10 14:05:22	AWinterman_	ericholscher: I feel like you're arguing that "clojerks" is an immoral name
2013-12-10 14:05:24	jarofghosts	its fine to disagree
2013-12-10 14:05:27	hackygolucky	you're expecting people to have your sense of humor.
2013-12-10 14:05:31	jarofghosts	but theres no way you dont think its just a joke
2013-12-10 14:05:32	JSON_voorhees	I think it's fine if you don't think that's a good idea i just disagree
2013-12-10 14:05:50	JSON_voorhees	programming is not laughing matter
2013-12-10 14:05:53	jarofghosts	true
2013-12-10 14:06:03	jarofghosts	were trying to put monkeys on the moon, damn it
2013-12-10 14:06:09	JSON_voorhees	and especially not my programming community
2013-12-10 14:06:17	jden	!m JSON_voorhees
2013-12-10 14:06:17	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work JSON_voorhees!
2013-12-10 14:06:20	ericholscher	what does haivng that be the name gain?
2013-12-10 14:06:21	-->	benedmunds (~textual@75-164-228-176.ptld.qwest.net) has joined #pdxnode
2013-12-10 14:06:26	JSON_voorhees	nothing
2013-12-10 14:06:29	AWinterman_	Can I emphasize again that outreach, marketing and services are more important than the name
2013-12-10 14:06:30	JSON_voorhees	it doesnt have to
2013-12-10 14:06:38	jden	ericholscher: delicious chicken
2013-12-10 14:06:45	AWinterman_	There's value in letting groups call themselves what they want
2013-12-10 14:06:54	JSON_voorhees	so jden and justinabrahms have the same argument
2013-12-10 14:06:55	ericholscher	censorship!
2013-12-10 14:07:14	 *	ericholscher sighs
2013-12-10 14:07:42	AWinterman_	I just don't think it actually does any harm.
2013-12-10 14:07:46	justinabrahms	huh?
2013-12-10 14:07:52	ericholscher	little things matter
2013-12-10 14:07:54	jden	no, I agree that it's probably not the best name for the group, and that it's not very welcoming
2013-12-10 14:07:55	jarofghosts	right
2013-12-10 14:08:02	jarofghosts	talk about a dangerous road...
2013-12-10 14:08:13	ericholscher	so why have a name that is offputting to some people if you gain nothing? or gain very little?
2013-12-10 14:08:19	jarofghosts	because they want to?
2013-12-10 14:08:22	JSON_voorhees	justinabrahms: clojerks just appreciate clojure and chicken
2013-12-10 14:08:26	jden	for one, it's not at all descriptive and doesn't even say what the group is about
2013-12-10 14:08:47	ericholscher	jarofghosts: really?
2013-12-10 14:08:50	jarofghosts	yes?
2013-12-10 14:08:51	AWinterman_	"Humans Interested in Talking About or Writing Clojure"
2013-12-10 14:08:55	justinabrahms	I think you guys are assuming malice where there likely isn't any. I don't think a bunch of clojure programmers are sitting around trying to figure out how to not get people to join them.
2013-12-10 14:09:06	jden	AWinterman_: now camelCase that and we're good to go!
2013-12-10 14:09:17	AWinterman_	jden: I don't think that's beginner friendly
2013-12-10 14:09:18	jarofghosts	no, some people cant talk
2013-12-10 14:09:21	JSON_voorhees	AWinterman_: too inclusive
2013-12-10 14:09:28	jarofghosts	dont be exclusionary

2013-12-10 14:10:12	ericholscher	the arguments are the same
2013-12-10 14:10:20	AWinterman_	yeah, but the context is COMPLETELY different
2013-12-10 14:10:21	JSON_voorhees	they cannot be
2013-12-10 14:10:39	jarofghosts	oh, dear
2013-12-10 14:10:43	ericholscher	"The subtle barbs are usually dismissed as something I need to not care about. It was a joke! Sheesh. Why are you so sensitive?! "
2013-12-10 14:11:09	ericholscher	i'm just saying its the same mindset
2013-12-10 14:11:10	jarofghosts	meet mr. straw man
2013-12-10 14:11:20	ericholscher	small things matter
2013-12-10 14:11:34	ericholscher	if you put up enough small signals that someone isn't welcome, they won't feel welcome
2013-12-10 14:11:37	ericholscher	so why add one more?
2013-12-10 14:11:47	ericholscher	because its funny?
2013-12-10 14:12:07	ericholscher	because you can?
2013-12-10 14:12:15	Wraithan	I'm with ericholscher on this. Naming matters, and that name purposely uses something negative to self identify.
2013-12-10 14:12:23	hackygolucky	to be honest and quite a damper, I think joking about being inclusive isn't productive way to go about things. I know that's lame.
2013-12-10 14:12:25	Wraithan	Making it off putting to some individuals
2013-12-10 14:12:45	JSON_voorhees	I think you are saying that someone might be offput but that name someday. Which could be said about literally anything.
2013-12-10 14:12:51	justinabrahms	ericholscher: You might consider reaching out to the clojure group about this.
2013-12-10 14:12:55	jarofghosts	its just hard to see the logical end of this argument
2013-12-10 14:13:02	hackygolucky	yup yup.
2013-12-10 14:13:09	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: It is off putting to me. ericholscher has said it was also off putting to him.
2013-12-10 14:13:15	ericholscher	jarofghosts: offputting names are bad, and we should try to be a bit more welcoming in all that we do

2013-12-10 14:13:36	hackygolucky	JSON_voorhees: same here.
2013-12-10 14:13:40	AWinterman_	I always thought of it as a nationality
2013-12-10 14:13:49	AWinterman_	like turk
2013-12-10 14:13:52	AWinterman_	except clojerk
2013-12-10 14:13:54	hackygolucky	JSON_voorhees: we've had this discussion at work previously about that exact group.
2013-12-10 14:13:57	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: it isn't the sole reason why I haven't gone, but it is a reason
2013-12-10 14:14:00	AWinterman_	what if they spelled it clojurk?
2013-12-10 14:14:06	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-10 14:14:08	AWinterman_	would we still be offended?
2013-12-10 14:14:13	ericholscher	AWinterman_: why does that matter?
2013-12-10 14:14:19	jarofghosts	good question!
2013-12-10 14:14:24	AWinterman_	because then it's not jerk, it's jurk
2013-12-10 14:14:24	JSON_voorhees	if you wrote clojure you would go
2013-12-10 14:14:26	ericholscher	its just distracting
2013-12-10 14:14:26	AWinterman_	which has no meaning

2013-12-10 14:14:55	hackygolucky	and I think we've officially taken this to a point beyond silliness :P
2013-12-10 14:15:01	JSON_voorhees	no shit
2013-12-10 14:15:03	eaculpa	yep!
2013-12-10 14:15:21	AWinterman_	I'm actually serious: If it was called clojurks, would this have ever come up?
2013-12-10 14:15:27	hackygolucky	I always love arguing until I actually do it.
2013-12-10 14:15:35	ericholscher	AWinterman_: maybe
2013-12-10 14:15:39	Wraithan	AWinterman_: pronunciation would make it a moot point imo
2013-12-10 14:15:55	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: you asked that once, I answered, not answering again.
2013-12-10 14:15:57	hackygolucky	AWinterman_: if the point was that it is meant to imply the word 'jerk' but with a 'u' because of clojure, yes.
2013-12-10 14:16:03	AWinterman_	well, but then it's a portmanteau of two totally inoffensive words
2013-12-10 14:16:08	AWinterman_	clojure and turk
2013-12-10 14:16:18	JSON_voorhees	it sounds like no matter what it was called someone could possibly be offput by it.
2013-12-10 14:16:23	ericholscher	JSON_voorhees: it isnt binary -- people don't go just because of the name, but its a small part of the decision
2013-12-10 14:16:25	Wraithan	AWinterman_: what does being a turk have to do with it?

2013-12-10 14:16:39	ericholscher	speaking of strawmen
2013-12-10 14:16:41	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: that's a bullshit argument and you know it
2013-12-10 14:16:43	AWinterman_	Wraithan: it's like a nationality
2013-12-10 14:16:56	Wraithan	turk is a very specific nationality
2013-12-10 14:17:09	hackygolucky	I really want to link the Logical Fallacies poster right now.
2013-12-10 14:17:11	AWinterman_	Wraithan: sorry, I meant it makes a clojurk like a ntionality
2013-12-10 14:17:26	AWinterman_	turk, attaturk, clojurk
2013-12-10 14:17:42	Wraithan	AWinterman_: ese, ish, an, etc are common things used to signify nationality, turk is pretty specific
2013-12-10 14:17:50	ericholscher	can we all agree that "jerk" has a negative connotation?
2013-12-10 14:17:53	Wraithan	^
2013-12-10 14:17:54	AWinterman_	yeah, turk provides the precedence
2013-12-10 14:17:57	AWinterman_	ericholscher: we can
2013-12-10 14:18:11	AWinterman_	the question is if all negative connotations always should be avoided in naming your group
2013-12-10 14:18:16	AWinterman_	I think the answer is it depends
2013-12-10 14:18:33	ericholscher	sure
2013-12-10 14:18:34	JSON_voorhees	i gotta get back to work... I just think that's an overreaction is all. But I think it's totally fine if you guys don't like that name.
2013-12-10 14:18:41	eaculpa	yeah
2013-12-10 14:18:42	Wraithan	I think in the vast majority of cases it is more inclusive to avoid it.

2013-12-12 13:27:13	 *	justinabrahms thinks _ should be in js's stdlib
2013-12-12 13:28:02	 *	justinabrahms also realizes that's an unpopular opinion in these parts.
2013-12-12 13:28:41	jden	I actually don't much like the underscore api - too much magic string programming to compensate for <ES6 having terrible lambdas
2013-12-12 13:29:05	jden	also, lousy (nonexistent) enumerables
2013-12-12 13:30:05	Wraithan	I don't use it but I totally understand people who do use it
2013-12-12 13:30:09	Wraithan	I am -0 on it

2013-12-12 13:38:43	dlmanning	The thing about klein bottles is that it's hard to know when to stop
2013-12-12 13:46:19	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: the irony is that it is in js's stdlib by and large, the method names are just (slightly) different :)

2013-12-12 13:54:44	othiym23	gotta answer his question
2013-12-12 13:57:34	justinabrahms	chrisdickinson: it's missing things that I want.
2013-12-12 13:57:40	justinabrahms	see also: _.cloneDeep, etc.
2013-12-12 13:57:49	justinabrahms	(lodash thing, rather than underscore specifically)
2013-12-12 13:58:28	dlmanning	jden: What's so bad about ES5 lambdas? The lack of lexical this?
2013-12-12 13:58:53	dlmanning	Cause... meh
2013-12-12 14:03:21	jden	dlmanning: they're too damn long
2013-12-12 14:03:40	jden	function (x) { return x.foo }) vs x=>x.foo
2013-12-12 14:03:46	Wraithan	eh
2013-12-12 14:04:25	chrisdickinson	jden: aren't parens still required for paremeters?
2013-12-12 14:04:38	chrisdickinson	*parameters, sorry.
2013-12-12 14:04:40	AWinterman	dlmanning: my main issue is they encourage bad habits
2013-12-12 14:04:58	chrisdickinson	(unless there's no params?)
2013-12-12 14:05:01	AWinterman	nesting lambdas is like the worst
2013-12-12 14:05:50	AWinterman	that said I actually really like how simple js is
2013-12-12 14:06:12	dlmanning	AWinterman: Just playing devil's advocate, but don't the shorter lambdas in ES6 encourage it more?
2013-12-12 14:06:30	AWinterman	dlmanning: no idea. Can you put parens in the fat arrow?
2013-12-12 14:06:35	AWinterman	or brackets rather?
2013-12-12 14:06:37	dlmanning	yes
2013-12-12 14:06:38	chrisdickinson	yes
2013-12-12 14:06:46	AWinterman	poop
2013-12-12 14:06:56	AWinterman	well I dislike that too then
2013-12-12 14:06:59	dlmanning	hah
2013-12-12 14:07:15	chrisdickinson	the forms (i know about) are: =>expr, ()=>expr, (<params>) => expr, (<params>) { expr }
2013-12-12 14:07:17	 *	AWinterman feels petulant
2013-12-12 14:07:23	AWinterman	I just put that in node.js by acident
2013-12-12 14:07:24	chrisdickinson	unsure if the braces keep the implied return
2013-12-12 14:07:24	AWinterman	oh well
2013-12-12 14:07:40	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-12-12 14:07:51	AWinterman	I really wish there was some language level impediment to infinitely nested lambdas
2013-12-12 14:08:13	dlmanning	Like if you weren't allowed to nest fat arrows inside far arrows?
2013-12-12 14:08:39	dlmanning	But then how would I do asynchronous programming??!
2013-12-12 14:08:43	AWinterman	dlmanning: like your fat arrows had to be 1 liners like in python
2013-12-12 14:08:44	AWinterman	hah
2013-12-12 14:08:45	dlmanning	}:-)
2013-12-12 14:09:14	chrisdickinson	also fun, to differentiate the fat arrow functions from normal functions (because they, of course, have different properties): `isFatArrow = (fn) => typeof fn === 'function' && ('' + fn).indexOf('function') !== 0`
2013-12-12 14:09:15	dlmanning	I just tilt my monitor 45 degrees and it's all good
2013-12-12 14:10:31	AWinterman	I just tilt my moniter 2 feet into jarofghosts desk and it's good
2013-12-12 14:10:49	jarofghosts	:D
2013-12-12 14:10:58	jarofghosts	that should be np
2013-12-12 14:11:07	jarofghosts	cannot foresee an issue
2013-12-12 14:11:08	AWinterman	actually it'd probably be fine
2013-12-12 14:11:20	AWinterman	so long as you stop raising and lowering your desk
2013-12-12 14:11:29	AWinterman	(you clojerk)

2013-12-12 14:11:35	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work AWinterman!
2013-12-12 14:12:59	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: What happens when you .toString() a fat arrow func?
2013-12-12 14:13:07	chrisdickinson	you get the source back
2013-12-12 14:13:21	dlmanning	Oh, but no function keyword
2013-12-12 14:13:24	dlmanning	duh
2013-12-12 14:14:31	AWinterman	 chrisdickinson who thinks it's a good idea for anonymous functions and their shorthand to have different properties?
2013-12-12 14:14:55	chrisdickinson	i think it's to encourage use of the `class` keyword
2013-12-12 14:15:08	chrisdickinson	iirc, you can't `new` a fat-arrow function
2013-12-12 14:15:17	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: just for you, I'm going to write a bindFatArrows module that wraps them in a real function and allows you to bind this and such
2013-12-12 14:15:22	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-12-12 14:15:40	dlmanning	And it's totally gonna use eval
2013-12-12 14:16:59	dlmanning	And I'll definitely have it just override bind()
2013-12-12 14:17:06	dlmanning	yeah, tots
2013-12-12 14:17:16	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-12-12 14:17:30	chrisdickinson	i want a shirt that says "yeah, tots" :)
2013-12-12 14:18:03	dlmanning	You can wear it to pubs and just point it at when they ask for your order
2013-12-12 14:23:02	jden	ha nice ^
2013-12-12 14:23:36	Wraithan	I used to hang out at Hungry Tiger Too, but they got rid of their tots so I stopped going
2013-12-12 14:24:12	chrisdickinson	i've walked by there before!
2013-12-12 14:24:19	chrisdickinson	and that's my yelp review of the place.
2013-12-12 14:24:36	chrisdickinson	"I have seen this restaurant. It is not a lie or ruse. It does in fact exist."
2013-12-12 14:24:38	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: pretty good food, they have drinks called 'all day sippers' they are fish bowls of alcohol
2013-12-12 14:24:44	chrisdickinson	whoa
2013-12-12 14:24:49	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: we should hang out there some time
2013-12-12 14:25:07	chrisdickinson	how many swift jars to a sipper?
2013-12-12 14:25:20	Wraithan	not on wednesday, because they ahve cheep corndogs/pbr and that place turns into even more of a hipster hangout
2013-12-12 14:25:38	Wraithan	cheep, like what a bird says, because they put birds on things
2013-12-12 14:26:04	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: maybe 1.25 or 1.5, but don't quote me on that, it has been a long while
2013-12-12 14:26:38	chrisdickinson	relevant to my interests
2013-12-12 14:26:57	chrisdickinson	both the cheep, the pbr, and the ratio
2013-12-12 14:27:03	chrisdickinson	well, "all of", not "both"
2013-12-12 14:30:21	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: just gets a bit too full for me on those nights
2013-12-12 14:30:35	Wraithan	during the summer it is better because they ahve the back porch to hang out on

2013-12-12 15:04:19	Wraithan	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2013-12-12 15:04:28	Wraithan	I am debating
2013-12-12 15:04:55	Wraithan	FL
2013-12-12 15:04:58	phated	always jsconf
2013-12-12 15:05:06	Wraithan	probably not

2013-12-12 15:05:10	jarofghosts	considered it
2013-12-12 15:05:12	phated	and beer
2013-12-12 15:05:13	jarofghosts	but not too fond of FL

2013-12-12 15:05:24	jarofghosts	that too
2013-12-12 15:05:26	phated	break it up, spend some time other places
2013-12-12 15:05:32	Wraithan	if I am going to long ass flight to a conference, it is going to be to EU or something
2013-12-12 15:05:41	Wraithan	already doing one east coast conf next year for pycon
2013-12-12 15:06:05	Wraithan	if they were closer together I'd consider just flying from Montreal to FL
2013-12-12 15:06:18	Wraithan	but I don't plan on spending a month on the east coast
2013-12-12 15:06:30	AWinterman	hackygolucky_:  I'd be interested in brushing this up and presenting it at a nodepdx in the FUTURE: http://awinterman.github.io/simple-scuttle/

2013-12-12 15:06:47	chrisdickinson	+1 i would like to hear that talk
2013-12-12 15:06:55	ericholscher	Wraithan: if it makes you feel any better, i'm flying all the way around the world to get to pycon :)
2013-12-12 15:06:58	hackygolucky_	AWinterman: that sounds like a really, really good idea.
2013-12-12 15:07:04	AWinterman	heh :)

2013-12-12 15:08:10	othiym23	phated: the short answer to your question is that I'm pretty sure that monkeypatching the implementation details of promises is not part of Promise/A+
2013-12-12 15:08:14	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: I like that better.

2013-12-12 15:08:34	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: ooh, be sure to pr your talk in (even after the fact) and link to your repo
2013-12-12 15:08:35	jarofghosts	belatedly for the idea of talking about simpscutt
2013-12-12 15:08:35	othiym23	phated: I'm pretty sure cls-q would eat shit and die on, say, bluebird promises
2013-12-12 15:08:35	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: nvcexploder noted that my talk could make a good workshop if we wanted to expand on it
2013-12-12 15:08:38	hackygolucky_	that was meant to sound silly and not commanding
2013-12-12 15:08:42	jarofghosts	as ive taken to referring to it as just now

2013-12-12 15:09:11	AWinterman	should I talk about the d3 implementation or about scuttlebutt
2013-12-12 15:09:11	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: in the vein of workshop planning, which is not what we were talking about
2013-12-12 15:09:14	nvcexploder	Wraithan: don't you think so?
2013-12-12 15:09:16	phated	othiym23: am bikeshedding a router i want, but it handles promises
2013-12-12 15:09:18	Wraithan	nvcexploder: totally
2013-12-12 15:09:22	othiym23	phated: there are really only a few circumstances in which cls-q is even necessary; it's not always required with Q
2013-12-12 15:09:25	Wraithan	nvcexploder: was just giving credit where credit is due
2013-12-12 15:09:31	Wraithan	it wasn't my idea, it is yours!
2013-12-12 15:09:53	jarofghosts	AWinterman reading through your documentation about scuttlebutt was my favorite part
2013-12-12 15:10:00	nvcexploder	Wraithan: nah - just one step further - I was thinking about it last night and thinking that just creating a simple mock IRC server would be easy
2013-12-12 15:10:01	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: huh?
2013-12-12 15:10:05	chrisdickinson	would love to hear about scuttlebutt the protocol/concept
2013-12-12 15:10:07	jarofghosts	despite how cool and interactive the d3 was
2013-12-12 15:10:09	hackygolucky_	we're always talking about workshops
2013-12-12 15:10:17	nvcexploder	nvcexploder: then you could step through each of the steps you took us through
2013-12-12 15:10:25	Wraithan	nvcexploder: talking to yourself there buddy?
2013-12-12 15:10:26	nvcexploder	Wraithan, btw
2013-12-12 15:10:27	hackygolucky_	I'm going to lock us in a room full of cookies until we hash out the spring calendar.
2013-12-12 15:10:28	Wraithan	nvcexploder: :D
2013-12-12 15:10:29	nvcexploder	not me
2013-12-12 15:10:31	nvcexploder	:)
2013-12-12 15:10:38	Wraithan	you highlighted yourself :)
2013-12-12 15:10:39	jarofghosts	so my vote is for scuttlebutt as well
2013-12-12 15:10:41	nvcexploder	hackygolucky_: SOLD.
2013-12-12 15:10:52	chrisdickinson	i'm going to try and put together a couple of year-end workshoppers
2013-12-12 15:10:54	phated	othiym23: okay, that's where i was confused - how do you know if the case is one of them? :P
2013-12-12 15:10:56	hackygolucky_	so pick your date, organizers, because I'm going to trap you
2013-12-12 15:11:04	Wraithan	nvcexploder: building a server is significantly more hard than building an IRC bot
2013-12-12 15:11:04	nvcexploder	anytime
2013-12-12 15:11:07	ericholscher	Wraithan: did you do the IRC bot building thing?
2013-12-12 15:11:07	chrisdickinson	need to work on ast-ronaut and from-russia-with-dvcs
2013-12-12 15:11:09	Wraithan	but we could do a simple IRC library
2013-12-12 15:11:15	AWinterman	chrisdickinson jarofghosts okay, scuttlebutt it'll be
2013-12-12 15:11:19	Wraithan	ericholscher: from scratch, not with zenircbot
2013-12-12 15:11:22	othiym23	phated: if CLS starts acting busted ;)
2013-12-12 15:11:23	nvcexploder	Wraithan: agreed
2013-12-12 15:11:24	ericholscher	ah, neat
2013-12-12 15:11:25	jarofghosts	sweet
2013-12-12 15:11:43	AWinterman	I can use my d3 demos to illustrate stuff and stuff
2013-12-12 15:11:49	hackygolucky_	jarofghosts: you wanna discuss scuttlebutt and simplescutt with AWinterman for an 'between the ferns' style talk?
2013-12-12 15:11:51	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-12-12 15:11:52	phated	othiym23: i'm not even sure if i know what it looks like when working correctly - but it looks amazing to me
2013-12-12 15:11:52	chrisdickinson	othiym23: was thinking about trying my hand at writing a browserify transform to implement CLS/async-listeners in the browser -- how stable is the API looking at the moment?

2013-12-12 15:12:00	jarofghosts	!m hackygolucky_
2013-12-12 15:12:00	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work hackygolucky_!
2013-12-12 15:12:00	hackygolucky_	I'm not kidding.
2013-12-12 15:12:06	hackygolucky_	I really want to play with formats
2013-12-12 15:12:14	ericholscher	I think its a neat idea, the workship I did at OSBridge went really well, and I think its great beginner material, lots of bang for buck, if they are an IRC user
2013-12-12 15:12:16	AWinterman	so jarofghosts and I would jsut talk about it?
2013-12-12 15:12:17	Wraithan	I wanna do more workshop style talks
2013-12-12 15:12:21	jarofghosts	so i should act offended about everything he says?
2013-12-12 15:12:23	hackygolucky_	AWinterman: not necessarily
2013-12-12 15:12:53	ericholscher	nvcexploder: https://speakerdeck.com/ericholscher/lets-make-an-irc-bot are the slides from the one I did at osbridge
2013-12-12 15:12:57	Wraithan	ericholscher: yeah, this went similarly, but required lets infrastructure to get going, and enabled folks to more easily build stuff on their own, some of these folks were on windows and such
2013-12-12 15:13:00	hackygolucky_	I think I just meant more of an opportunity to hear you guys talk about it a little after running through simplescutt
2013-12-12 15:13:08	ericholscher	Wraithan: nice
2013-12-12 15:13:15	ericholscher	!m Wraithan

2013-12-12 15:13:18	jarofghosts	err
2013-12-12 15:13:22	othiym23	chrisdickinson: trevnorris is busy reworking process.{add,remove,create}Listener's API right now
2013-12-12 15:13:23	Wraithan	ericholscher: and lots of them were beginners with node and in some cases programming
2013-12-12 15:13:28	Wraithan	I didn't want to lose them in the pub/sub
2013-12-12 15:13:29	jarofghosts	im not sure how much i would add to the convo
2013-12-12 15:13:31	othiym23	he claims it's the last time before the API is frozen
2013-12-12 15:13:43	ericholscher	Wraithan: did you just use a wrapper library or something?
2013-12-12 15:13:44	jarofghosts	all i know is what AWinterman explained
2013-12-12 15:13:46	ericholscher	or a node irc lib?
2013-12-12 15:13:49	Wraithan	ericholscher: node irc lib
2013-12-12 15:13:52	hackygolucky_	jarofghosts: but yes, you should act totally offended.
2013-12-12 15:13:54	ericholscher	cool
2013-12-12 15:14:00	othiym23	chrisdickinson: I've talkd to nrn about the possibility of making an asyncListener shim for the browser before, maybe you could team up with him and fight crime?
2013-12-12 15:14:28	AWinterman	I'd also better hook up simple-scuttle via http or something to make sure it's not, you know, unusable
2013-12-12 15:14:28	nvcexploder	ericholscher: rad!
2013-12-12 15:14:34	chrisdickinson	i haven't met nrn! but that is a distinct possibility.
2013-12-12 15:14:55	chrisdickinson	oh wait
2013-12-12 15:15:03	chrisdickinson	I have, I have just never seen his screen name before :)
2013-12-12 15:15:04	othiym23	phated: with the most recent changes on CLS master, it should start complaining very noisily when it's not working (i.e. it throws when there's no context on which to send)
2013-12-12 15:15:10	Wraithan	nvcexploder: how does building an IRC bot from scratch sound, just using the standard library and maybe things like split()? that is a bit heavier on the parsing side and you have to open the socket yourself, but I think if I had 2 hours I could make that work
2013-12-12 15:15:12	othiym23	chrisdickinson: yeah, I was gonna say ;)
2013-12-12 15:15:14	phated	othiym23: hooray!
2013-12-12 15:15:37	phated	othiym23: i think you solved the last piece of my bikeshed
2013-12-12 15:15:49	Wraithan	socket programming is really cool, even if you don't need to do it all the time and generally have abstractions
2013-12-12 15:16:04	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: i think that would be neat
2013-12-12 15:16:20	chrisdickinson	a lot of the cool in node comes from how easy it makes dealing with text/binary streams of data, I think.
2013-12-12 15:16:21	othiym23	phated: eliminating the "default" context is a potentially very disruptive change, but it's necessary for security reasons anyway, so I'll probably be publishing that new version before the end of the year, hopefully with the new / final version of the async-listener shim API
2013-12-12 15:16:29	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: agreed
2013-12-12 15:16:35	Wraithan	and this would demonstrate that
2013-12-12 15:16:48	phated	othiym23: i was reading that issue at the airport today, makes sense

2013-12-12 15:17:30	Wraithan	ok
2013-12-12 15:17:44	Wraithan	I'll play with it a bit and see if I am comfortable with it after I write out a couple of the talks
2013-12-12 15:17:54	chrisdickinson	the other nice thing about workshopper is that it provides easy prereqs for classes
2013-12-12 15:18:12	hackygolucky_	wait, what is workshopper again?
2013-12-12 15:18:13	chrisdickinson	"you should complete stream-adventure before X" for example

2013-12-12 15:18:31	phated	who said workshopper?
2013-12-12 15:18:33	phated	don't use it
2013-12-12 15:18:34	hackygolucky_	oh!
2013-12-12 15:18:36	phated	it's bad
2013-12-12 15:18:37	hackygolucky_	why not?
2013-12-12 15:18:41	phated	really bad
2013-12-12 15:18:42	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: I was thinking about doing an irc workshopper but realized it would be hard without dependency injection to mock out the sockets

2013-12-12 15:18:47	othiym23	lol
2013-12-12 15:18:52	phated	we all tired using it for havestJS workshops
2013-12-12 15:18:57	phated	it failed in all use cases
2013-12-12 15:19:01	dlmanning	phated: you say that, but you like using require.js
2013-12-12 15:19:02	phated	so we all wrote our own
2013-12-12 15:19:17	dlmanning	So your taste is questionable at best ;)

2013-12-12 15:19:34	Wraithan	if not building on top of it
2013-12-12 15:20:05	chrisdickinson	phated: what problems did you run into?
2013-12-12 15:20:51	phated	chrisdickinson: i ran into tons because i was using the command line
2013-12-12 15:21:04	phated	but contra was trying to use it proper and still couldn't get things working
2013-12-12 15:21:12	phated	he patched a bunch and entered issues
2013-12-12 15:21:47	phated	chrisdickinson: talking to contra now in #wearefractal and he says his stuff isn't done/working yet

2013-12-12 15:22:12	jarofghosts	as in nevermind
2013-12-12 15:22:31	phated	i did my stuff with node's readline and promises, but it was all custom

2013-12-12 15:22:53	phated	workshopper works for a crazy small and focused use case
2013-12-12 15:23:09	Wraithan	phated: I'd be tempted to try workshopper and report issues before I go off on my own
2013-12-12 15:23:15	Wraithan	just in the interest of making it better for the future
2013-12-12 15:23:25	Wraithan	but I can see what you are saying
2013-12-12 15:23:41	Wraithan	And appreciate the warning
2013-12-12 15:23:43	dlmanning	The documentation was pretty bad last time I looked
2013-12-12 15:23:46	phated	and trying to make your class/workshop fit that use case limits what you can teach
2013-12-12 15:24:14	phated	Wraithan: i am less prone to do it for a project with bad documentation, that was barely touched at the time, from someone i dislike
2013-12-12 15:24:28	phated	Wraithan: but contra did it your way and it still was painful for him

2013-12-12 15:31:12	Wraithan	ok, so we can/need to run the stream workshop before we run the IRC from scratch workshop, I'll look through to see if any others are needed
2013-12-12 15:31:15	Wraithan	maybe I'll make a regex one
2013-12-12 15:32:13	phated	btw, take a look at the HarvestJS stuff we did
2013-12-12 15:32:17	phated	to see if any of it works
2013-12-12 15:32:36	Wraithan	phated: yeah, I will, just starting to think about things I want to run
2013-12-12 15:32:48	Wraithan	instead of working like I should be
2013-12-12 15:32:53	Wraithan	because work is silly

2013-12-12 15:34:05	Wraithan	luckily python's csv module is actually pretty decent for my usecase
2013-12-12 15:35:04	AWinterman	python's csv module is really good
2013-12-12 15:35:07	AWinterman	used to be my bread and butter
2013-12-12 15:36:59	ericholscher	http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ is pretty neat too
2013-12-12 15:37:19	ericholscher	adds lots of little CLI utilities for working w/ CSV's
2013-12-12 15:37:42	Wraithan	ericholscher: oh nice
2013-12-12 15:37:44	Wraithan	thanks
2013-12-12 15:37:52	Wraithan	might use that when I get done with this to verify my data is good
2013-12-12 15:38:00	Wraithan	in the actual outputed file
2013-12-12 15:38:07	Wraithan	I'm writing tests
2013-12-12 15:38:13	Wraithan	so those already catch some things
2013-12-12 15:38:19	ericholscher	its pretty neat for just playing w/ data, not sure about testing
2013-12-12 15:38:50	Wraithan	ericholscher: well, not for automated testing, just grabbing data out and looking at it
2013-12-12 15:38:57	ericholscher	ah yea, good for that
2013-12-12 15:39:01	Wraithan	because these csvs will have 50-100 columns

2013-12-12 16:27:32	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: my biggest worry of using set timeout exclusively is if your bot gets restarted or something you lose your alarms

2013-12-12 16:44:14	othiym23	dlmanning: most sites using Riak are using leveldb for the storage engine now
2013-12-12 16:44:32	dlmanning	othiym23: cool, good to know
2013-12-12 16:45:23	othiym23	phated: I think the most important thing about the levelup / leveldown / leveldb ecosystem is that it observes Node values on composition, so you can choose how much of a DBMS you need for your app and build appropriately
2013-12-12 16:45:28	othiym23	I think that's a pretty promising idea
2013-12-12 16:45:44	othiym23	there's no real reason e.g. your query language and your storage engine need to be tightly coupled
2013-12-12 16:46:00	othiym23	in fact, maybe now is the time for me to write a Production D parser and hook it up to leveldb
2013-12-12 16:46:20	 *	dlmanning goes off to write a leveldb wrapper to make it act like COBOL

2013-12-12 16:46:58	othiym23	dlmanning: no way dude, write a PICK interpreter
2013-12-12 16:47:12	othiym23	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_operating_system
2013-12-12 16:47:33	phated	othiym23: i must be missing something then cuz it seems to be underpowered
2013-12-12 16:48:05	dlmanning	:D
2013-12-12 16:48:18	othiym23	phated: on its own, leveldb is just a dirt simple storage format that gives you a couple data storage principles
2013-12-12 16:48:24	nvcexploder	othiym23: PICK
2013-12-12 16:48:48	othiym23	phated: and levelup is just a simple query wrapper around that
2013-12-12 16:48:59	phated	othiym23: but it locks... or did i do something wrong
2013-12-12 16:49:01	othiym23	phated: but look at stuff like brycebaril's timestream and it gets more interesting
2013-12-12 16:49:28	othiym23	phated: you need locking for ACID, and it's definitely meant to be durable
2013-12-12 16:49:37	othiym23	but so what, if locking and unlocking are fast?
2013-12-12 16:50:04	othiym23	I mean, leveldb isn't that different from sleepycat or whatever, because it's just a storage engine
2013-12-12 16:51:01	phated	othiym23: i am no db expert, so i'm not too sure what those mean
2013-12-12 16:51:50	othiym23	phated: so ACID is just atomicity, consistency, integrity, and durability, right?
2013-12-12 16:52:19	phated	i'll take your word on that
2013-12-12 16:52:28	phated	i thought it was a drug
2013-12-12 16:52:45	othiym23	if you want those properties, you either need to serialize access to your data store, you need a smart merge strategy or something like commutatitve data types, or you need something like MVCC (which is basically optimistic locking for grownups)
2013-12-12 16:53:22	othiym23	see also: the recent brouhaha over Redis Cluster and distributed database experts tearing Salvatore a new asshole because he's more or less making shit up as he goes along
2013-12-12 16:53:41	AWinterman	heh
2013-12-12 16:54:20	othiym23	nvcexploder: do you have experience with the almighty PICK?
2013-12-12 16:54:52	nvcexploder	othiym23: not much - I know what it is - a company I did work with AGES ago still has a production system in PICK
2013-12-12 16:55:26	AWinterman	othiym23: how does serialization help with ACID?
2013-12-12 16:57:09	adamdicarlo	... if emacs is a lisp interpreter that happens to have a text editor bundled in... why do we not have a js-macs?
2013-12-12 16:57:18	othiym23	AWinterman: serialization is a necessary precondition for atomicity (ensuring only one process is writing a given tuple at once) and consistency (so all clients see the same value of the relation)

2013-12-13 10:16:33	hackygolucky_	I think what I struggle with is that there are a number of groups doing the same thing as Girl Develop It and they seem to not share resources

2013-12-13 10:17:03	AWinterman	hackygolucky_: girls who code, girl scouts, etc?

2013-12-13 10:18:24	hackygolucky_	AWinterman: but yes, overall, I think we absolutely need that here.
2013-12-13 10:19:02	hackygolucky_	better community outreach, and that includes spanning age groups(high school kids, perhaps) and also areas of town
2013-12-13 10:19:13	hackygolucky_	i find downtown Portland and many software developers to be detached from the community at large

2013-12-13 15:30:39	jden	hackygolucky_: to the above, my first thought was "does justinabrahms know?" but I didn't wanna be *that* dramafly
2013-12-13 15:38:55	hackygolucky_	we're a very modern couple.
2013-12-13 15:38:57	hackygolucky_	heh

2013-12-13 15:39:53	JSON_voorhees	What if a library like say select2 included a file of page object helpers for selenium testing?
2013-12-13 15:41:26	JSON_voorhees	select2 specifically creates a difficult componenet to target in selenium tests.. but you could have helpers like getSelect2('yourAppSpecificClassname') that would return the element.
2013-12-13 15:41:51	JSON_voorhees	or select2ChooseOption(optionName)

2013-12-13 15:45:23	jden	hmmm. yeah everytime I've used selenium I've ended up writing tons of app-specific helpers like that for my sanity
2013-12-13 15:46:08	JSON_voorhees	jden: right. I would really like to figure out a way to make these less specific and reusable
2013-12-13 15:46:18	JSON_voorhees	but that's pretty much the nature of selenium testing...
2013-12-13 15:46:32	Wraithan	I remember doing a bunch of attempts at more generic helpers in python for that problem
2013-12-13 15:46:40	Wraithan	most of them were failures
2013-12-13 15:46:55	JSON_voorhees	is any of it on thegithub?
2013-12-13 15:47:08	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorhees: happy birthday!
2013-12-13 15:47:16	JSON_voorhees	thanks dogg
2013-12-13 15:47:30	Wraithan	Nah, ended up not open sourcing them because the parts that were useful were super small
2013-12-13 15:48:14	Wraithan	and I had a hard time getting time for open source at that company, especially at that time
2013-12-13 15:48:21	JSON_voorhees	ahh interesting. 
2013-12-13 15:48:41	JSON_voorhees	If I come up with anything useful I'll have to get your input

2013-12-16 11:16:23	othiym23	want to present something about ES6 and asynchrony that's appropriate for the JSConf audience
2013-12-16 11:16:27	othiym23	probably won't be super Node-specific
2013-12-16 11:17:43	@hackygolucky	othiym23: mine won't be node specific. I've already submitted.
2013-12-16 11:17:53	@hackygolucky	crossing fingers but excited to go either way.
2013-12-16 11:17:58	othiym23	yeah, me too

2013-12-16 16:19:15	dlmanning	yeah. it's nice that bootstrap is written in less

2013-12-16 16:19:47	phated	yeah

2013-12-16 16:22:21	chrisdickinson	because arrays are object

2013-12-16 16:22:24	phated	jsconf b-track is usually sponsors
2013-12-16 16:22:26	chrisdickinson	everyhing is an object
2013-12-16 16:22:36	jarofghosts	because an array is just an object
2013-12-16 16:22:40	@hackygolucky	phated: works for me. Didn't know that was a thing.
2013-12-16 16:22:45	chrisdickinson	arrays are just special objects whose keys happen to be numbers
2013-12-16 16:22:53	phated	JSON_voorhees: don't do that!
2013-12-16 16:22:53	dlmanning	JSON_voorhees: Because of oppression
2013-12-16 16:22:54	jarofghosts	and that have a `length`
2013-12-16 16:23:05	othiym23	RejectJS Berlin had an awesome lineup this year
2013-12-16 16:23:08	JSON_voorhees	haha I would never, caught it in code review
2013-12-16 16:23:11	chrisdickinson	a dynamic length getter/setter property!
2013-12-16 16:23:38	phated	JSON_voorhees: we had that in frozen for awhile...i yelled at monteslu
2013-12-16 16:23:43	JSON_voorhees	apparently their is a reason why they did that.. Eager to see why
2013-12-16 16:23:45	othiym23	good ol' expandos
2013-12-16 16:24:31	othiym23	JSON_voorhees: the only way it doesn't work is if you set properties on "value objects" (numbers, strings, a couple others)
2013-12-16 16:24:34	phated	othiym23: except maccana :P
2013-12-16 16:24:42	chrisdickinson	well
2013-12-16 16:24:49	chrisdickinson	it works, but isn't useful
2013-12-16 16:25:24	chrisdickinson	anytime you see `x.y`, or `x[y]`, x is either already an object or promoted to an object (modulo x === undefined || x === null)
2013-12-16 16:25:27	othiym23	and that's because when you do var num = 1; num.property = 'ham', what you're actually getting is new Number(1).property = 'ham', and the result of that instantiation + assignment is discarded
2013-12-16 16:25:31	chrisdickinson	yep
2013-12-16 16:25:41	chrisdickinson	boxing and unboxing!
2013-12-16 16:25:52	othiym23	JSON_voorhees: Dave Herman's Effective JavaScript has a really good, terse explanation of what's happening there
2013-12-16 16:26:09	dlmanning	othiym23: That statement is usually true

2013-12-16 16:26:20	@hackygolucky	othiym23: SUCH a good book.
2013-12-16 16:26:26	othiym23	my most ringing endorsement of JavaScript texts
2013-12-16 16:26:27	@hackygolucky	that was my intro book at UA

2013-12-16 16:26:52	@hackygolucky	Still trying to find one.
2013-12-16 16:27:00	@hackygolucky	that I can really recommend.
2013-12-16 16:27:01	chrisdickinson	well, we're still pre-1.0 :|
2013-12-16 16:27:14	othiym23	if 1.0 ever comes out, I may take a stab at it
2013-12-16 16:27:25	othiym23	I've got a pretty good idea of what approach to take at this point
2013-12-16 16:27:37	othiym23	also I've never published a book and that would be kind of neat

2013-12-16 16:41:13	chrisdickinson	re: the libuv + v8 bindings, i'm conflicted. I like the idea of having less core; but want to lean on things like async-listener, promises, streams
2013-12-16 16:41:15	phated	node.asm is the best name
2013-12-16 16:41:19	chrisdickinson	es6 modules
2013-12-16 16:41:33	phated	promises are in v8
2013-12-16 16:41:37	chrisdickinson	yep
2013-12-16 16:41:56	phated	does async-listener need to be in core?
2013-12-16 16:42:02	dlmanning	creationix just
2013-12-16 16:42:04	chrisdickinson	i'd say yes
2013-12-16 16:42:04	phated	streams will be in
2013-12-16 16:42:15	dlmanning	really wants continuables
2013-12-16 16:42:15	othiym23	phated: seeing as how my polyfill runs faster than the version in core right now, maybe not ;)
2013-12-16 16:42:16	chrisdickinson	well, they'll be in the dom
2013-12-16 16:42:22	othiym23	trevnorris is fixing that, though
2013-12-16 16:42:36	phated	othiym23: hahahaha
2013-12-16 16:43:01	othiym23	chrisdickinson: but then the question becomes what constitutes no.js?
2013-12-16 16:43:01	phated	chrisdickinson: getting something in dom is just an easy way to get around tc39
2013-12-16 16:43:17	othiym23	chrisdickinson: you don't need anything for promises, they just need ES5
2013-12-16 16:43:54	phated	wonder when we will have es6 modules behind a flag
2013-12-16 16:43:59	phated	since everything is settled now
2013-12-16 16:45:31	othiym23	"settled"
2013-12-16 16:45:38	chrisdickinson	othiym23: right; that's kind of why I'm conflicted: I like the idea of a node core with less surface area, but also like the idea of a node core that reflects knowledge gained
2013-12-16 16:45:52	othiym23	they're still working on the module loader spec, and there's still some squabbling
2013-12-16 16:46:34	othiym23	there are many different kinds of wisdom that have been gained in the Node community
2013-12-16 16:47:17	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-12-16 16:47:18	phated	othiym23: "Dave Herman: Spec draft: Done. Initial implementation for Firefox, POC for spec: jorendorff/js-loaders"
2013-12-16 16:47:22	othiym23	creationix wisdom and substack wisdom are very different, and both are different from tjfontaine wisdom

2013-12-16 16:47:42	othiym23	phated: sure, but I'm on es-discuss, and I can tell you they're still arguing about it
2013-12-16 16:48:00	othiym23	most of the big shit is dealt with, but read Rick's last set of TC39 f2f notes if you don't believe me

2013-12-16 16:49:23	othiym23	I'm wondering if isaacs is going to ease up on his "ES6 modules \/\/" stance once they're in V8 without a flag
2013-12-16 16:49:41	chrisdickinson	on the "knowledge gained" side I want a lack of event emitters, baked in async-listeners / domains, promises, a stream spec, and to rely on es6's module system.
2013-12-16 16:49:46	chrisdickinson	also, a dog and a pony
2013-12-16 16:50:35	phated	and a sandwich
2013-12-16 16:50:43	othiym23	minus the promises
2013-12-16 16:50:44	chrisdickinson	made out of dog and pony.
2013-12-16 16:50:49	phated	othiym23: shoo!
2013-12-16 16:50:53	othiym23	promises are useful, don't belong in the platform tbqh
2013-12-16 16:51:09	phated	othiym23: have you tried to use any of the FFOS APIs?
2013-12-16 16:51:13	phated	they are horrible
2013-12-16 16:51:16	phated	and need promises
2013-12-16 16:51:18	othiym23	at least not until ES has real microtask support or a standardized event loop
2013-12-16 16:51:20	chrisdickinson	I think whether or not they belong at platform level, they're kind of ending up there
2013-12-16 16:51:33	phated	DOMEvents are the worst thing ever
2013-12-16 16:51:37	othiym23	well yeah
2013-12-16 16:51:39	othiym23	no argument there
2013-12-16 16:51:52	phated	they have a single resolved value
2013-12-16 16:52:09	phated	fn(err, data) won't be in the platform
2013-12-16 16:52:12	phated	ever
2013-12-16 16:52:27	othiym23	but either you use process.nextTick and risk event loop starvation or use setTimeout(fn, 0) and lose a little performance

2013-12-16 16:53:00	othiym23	I'm interested in where Domenic's DOM Streams proposal ends up
2013-12-16 16:53:07	chrisdickinson	same
2013-12-16 16:53:11	othiym23	I'm hoping he manages to successfuly whisk the pony out of the shitpile
2013-12-16 16:54:12	chrisdickinson	that is now probably my favorite colloquialism
2013-12-16 16:55:14	dlmanning	I was gonna say
2013-12-16 16:55:16	chrisdickinson	"who even has a horse-sized whisk?"
2013-12-16 16:55:26	othiym23	not that kind of whisk
2013-12-16 16:55:28	chrisdickinson	(at least, that's the meaning of whisk I am gravitating towards in this case)
2013-12-16 16:55:33	othiym23	whisk as in "to spirit away"
2013-12-16 16:55:38	othiym23	like in Spirited Away
2013-12-16 16:55:46	othiym23	I'm saying that's a ghost pony with parents who are greedy dicks
2013-12-16 16:55:51	chrisdickinson	haha

2013-12-20 14:21:10	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees, justinabrahms: Is there a way for me to get all of my issues on sprintly in a single list sorted by priority, instead of broken out in to the backlog/current lists?
2013-12-20 14:21:50	Wraithan	I have no clear way, other than management telling me, that something added to my backlog is higher priority than something I've started
2013-12-20 14:23:34	justinabrahms	Wraithan: reports view?
2013-12-20 14:23:52	justinabrahms	oh, finished reading.
2013-12-20 14:23:54	justinabrahms	The answer is no.
2013-12-20 14:24:16	justinabrahms	I don't think there's a technical answer to "hey, there's a pants-on-fire bug and you shouldn't be working on the thing you're working on"
2013-12-20 14:24:56	Wraithan	justinabrahms: sure but if a number of actually important issues get added when you've already started on low priority stuff because the queue ran low, you don't notice until someone says something
2013-12-20 14:25:56	Wraithan	pants on fire are totally something I'm cool with management or someone having to message me
2013-12-20 14:26:23	justinabrahms	Priority isn't a global notion. It's only within the context of a given phase.
2013-12-20 14:26:33	Wraithan	I see
2013-12-20 14:27:10	Wraithan	I guess I am just reaching for something closer to bugzilla/jira and finding sprintly falls short when I treat it like them
2013-12-20 14:27:24	Wraithan	maybe it is just the wrong approach to this software
2013-12-20 14:27:36	Wraithan	I mean, my approach is wrong for how this software works
2013-12-20 14:27:50	Wraithan	not that your approach is wrong, just different from what I am looking for
2013-12-20 14:28:02	justinabrahms	We don't aim to obviate the need for communication amongst the team. We also assume that you are working from a reasonably well stocked backlog that is prioritized appropriately.
2013-12-20 14:28:45	Wraithan	In this case it is shorter term work so the backlog isn't large
2013-12-20 14:29:14	Wraithan	and so when 5 new tickets come in, it doubles to quadruples my backlog
2013-12-20 14:29:19	justinabrahms	I would say there are a few fixes here.
2013-12-20 14:29:43	justinabrahms	the first could be that the person assigning / creating work does more up-front input of things they might want you to do.
2013-12-20 14:30:06	justinabrahms	2, you could break tasks down into smaller pieces such that the time between looking for more tickets isn't substantial
2013-12-20 14:30:29	justinabrahms	you should get email when new tickets are assigned to you, which can be a prompting.
2013-12-20 14:31:19	justinabrahms	http://blog.sprint.ly/post/41801740808/visions-of-a-post-agile-world and http://blog.sprint.ly/post/43576389119/agile-anti-patterns-in-non-blocking-development are relevant
2013-12-20 14:31:59	Wraithan	So your stance is that we are not optimally using sprintly?
2013-12-20 14:32:05	justinabrahms	to continue with the "treat your makers as asynchronous threads" metaphor, I suppose what you're asking for is a way to preempt.
2013-12-20 14:32:08	Wraithan	Which sounds true enough
2013-12-20 14:32:36	justinabrahms	Wraithan: It's possible, but I don't know that I would say that without knowing more.
2013-12-20 14:32:51	Wraithan	I'm just looking for ways to actually figure out what my whole picture looks like, without taking into account what I've "started" and what is just in my backlog
2013-12-20 14:33:38	Wraithan	jira/bugzilla I can see all tickets assigned to me, and sort them by their various fields, which includes priority
2013-12-20 14:34:00	Wraithan	the report stuff seems to be a good portion of the way there, I hadn't looked into that
2013-12-20 14:34:09	justinabrahms	it's new as of yesterday :)
2013-12-20 14:34:22	Wraithan	Ah ok
2013-12-20 14:34:50	justinabrahms	 I would say that trashing between what is the most important right now can be really problematic. Increasing a buffer between those things is usually really helpful (for sanity if nothing else)
2013-12-20 14:35:09	justinabrahms	see also: GIL ^_^
2013-12-20 14:36:25	justinabrahms	I wouldn't go as far as to say you guys are doing it non-optimally, but I will say that it doesn't reflect how my team runs, nor have I heard of many other people doing it that way.
2013-12-20 14:36:36	justinabrahms	I consider a great deal of that to be selection bias though.
2013-12-20 14:36:41	Wraithan	This is why I ignore bugmail and only look at my lists when I feel like I could reasonably change tasks
2013-12-20 14:39:36	justinabrahms	Got it. You  are prepared to change tasks before you're finished with the current task, but don't know if you should. I don't have an answer for this. :-/
2013-12-20 14:40:47	Wraithan	justinabrahms: usually I look when I find a task to be partially complete, but the next part is going to take a long time, and picking up a couple faster bugs could be more optimal while I come up with the solution for the one I have partially complete

2013-12-20 15:44:38	Wraithan	if we tried to do nodebots monthly I'd want to try to mix it up with dorkbot
2013-12-20 15:44:56	Wraithan	but I am more on the side of quarterly
2013-12-20 15:45:01	jden	dlmanning: excatly
2013-12-20 15:45:08	Wraithan	mostly because I already have too many meetups I mean to go to
2013-12-20 15:45:18	jden	yeah, no need to overcommit
2013-12-20 15:45:36	jden	one of the cool things that sf is doing is for the next 3 months building sumobots
2013-12-20 15:45:48	jden	so participants can work on one project over a longer period of time
2013-12-20 15:45:54	Wraithan	but not opposed to getting the dorkbot folks involved anyway, they are rad, lots of them doing musical stuff
2013-12-20 15:46:00	dlmanning	I heard SF was totally over
2013-12-20 15:46:16	hackygolucky	Wraithan: I'm a big fan of quarterly with that sort of thing.
2013-12-20 15:46:17	jden	nodebots sf is the cool sf node community

2013-12-23 11:41:00	thoward	hackygolucky_: missed your question earlier. first nodepdx was held in NedSpace, a co-working space in downtown. At the time, they were in the same building ESRI is in, on the ground/basement floors, but have since moved to a new location.
2013-12-23 11:41:34	thoward	hackygolucky_: they donated the space for free, and it had a capacity of about 150ppl.

2013-12-23 12:20:41	thoward	hackygolucky_: so i'm starting the nodepdx venue search now. we didn't really settle anything firmly, but it seems that the general consensus was to do the confs separately, with nodepdx being earlier (apr/may) and cjs being later (eg aug/sep), so that's what i'm shooting for w/ event space inquiries at the moment.
2013-12-23 12:21:09	hackygolucky_	thoward: cool beans. Let me know what I can do to help!
2013-12-23 12:23:13	thoward	no prob. also, i'll pass along venue info as i get it. a lot of these places don't publicize room layouts/diagrams or rental pricing, which is a bit annoying because you have to engage in numerous email threads, just to obtain enough info to rule something out. i try to retain all that info for subsequent events.
2013-12-23 12:25:01	thoward	i'm targeting 200 people for NPDX 2014, and looking for event spaces that have one main space that can hold ~250 people, with at least one or two other rooms that can hold around 100 each. the goal is to do something like a multi-track workshop style setup, with the option of having everyon congregate in the main space for lunch/keynotes/etc.
2013-12-23 12:25:31	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky_: barebonesconf?
2013-12-23 12:27:17	thoward	http://barebonesconference.com/
2013-12-23 12:27:21	hackygolucky_	thoward: sounds perfect. I'm really excited to see how the different styles of conf complement the attendees of the conference.
2013-12-23 12:27:35	hackygolucky_	and that info regarding venues would be super helpful.
2013-12-23 12:28:27	thoward	also, at the happy data hour event, i started a conversation w/ Ben Jones, about doing a 18 and younger programming conference.
2013-12-23 12:29:03	thoward	i'm pretty excited to do that, and ben is already working locally with a medium sized meetup group for that community.
2013-12-23 12:29:03	hackygolucky_	thoward: whoa. Super nice. As a separate conf or a component of NPDX?
2013-12-23 12:29:38	thoward	well.. as a separate conf, but i was thinking that we could do it similar to how the couch conf and CJS shared the same space/utilities just on different days.
2013-12-23 12:29:48	 *	hackygolucky_ nods
2013-12-23 12:30:02	thoward	so NPDX/KidsConf (need a name still) could share all the resources.
2013-12-23 12:30:58	--	hackygolucky_ is now known as hackygolucky
2013-12-23 12:31:00	thoward	it'd be fun to see which conf has a more awesome after party
2013-12-23 12:31:30	hackygolucky	I... don't think that's a good arms race to start :P
2013-12-23 12:31:43	hackygolucky	or maybe it is
2013-12-23 12:31:46	 *	hackygolucky shrugs
2013-12-23 12:32:17	thoward	hehe, well, the goal would be to teach the adults how to party without booze
2013-12-23 12:33:36	hackygolucky	a worthy goal.
2013-12-23 12:33:47	thoward	i was thining we could do combined ticketing also.. kidsconf is intended to be free or crazy cheap (like $5-10), and all kidsconf people get into NPDX for free.
2013-12-23 12:34:07	thoward	but you have to be under 18
2013-12-23 12:34:22	thoward	or maybe 21 or 16. trying to figure out the right boundaries.
2013-12-23 12:34:48	hackygolucky	thoward: so are that fewer tickets offered to general public in place of those coming from Kidsconf?
2013-12-23 12:35:04	-->	phated (~phated@c-24-21-53-221.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #pdxnode
2013-12-23 12:35:18	hackygolucky	also, I'm assuming npdx would be providing no alcohol at events? I don't know how this stuff works when minors lurk.
2013-12-23 12:38:17	thoward	well -- my goal for 2014 is to do something like this: plan the space to accomodate 250-300ish, sell up to 100 kidsconf tickets @ $10, and 100 npdx tickets @ $50, with at least 100 folks on a buddy list. each kidsconf ticket gets a kid+parent(s) in. each NPDX ticket gets you + 1 buddy in.
2013-12-23 12:38:38	thoward	so, it's possible, in the worst case scenario to have 500 people show up.
2013-12-23 12:38:44	thoward	but that won't happen

2013-12-23 12:40:14	thoward	first, i'd be surprised to get 100 people turn out for kids conf. that'd be awesome, but i'd be suprised. i'd be even more surprised if more than say 30 of those people came to NPDX as well.
2013-12-23 12:40:33	thoward	more than likely that would be say.. 50 extra people at NPDX.
2013-12-23 12:41:11	thoward	every conf i've ever done, has an attrition rate from the sold tickets, usually kind of high. second day drop off is high as well.
2013-12-23 12:41:46	thoward	so if i sell "200 tickets" often, only 150-175 people would show up first day, and second day 100-150.
2013-12-23 12:42:30	thoward	so if i plan for a capacity of 250-300 in the main space, plus two ancillary spaces of about 100 each, that should be more than enough
2013-12-23 12:42:49	thoward	even in worst case of 500 people showing up, there'd be enough room... technically. ;)
2013-12-23 12:43:51	hackygolucky	yeesh. heh. PyCon started doing a big push for kids tutorials and the attendance was fantastic.
2013-12-23 12:44:01	thoward	Portland Public Schools are out of session on Friday, April 11th, for a teachers planning day. so i was thinking kidsconf on 4/11, npdx 4/12-13
2013-12-23 12:44:02	hackygolucky	I can't remember if they went with PyKids or not.
2013-12-23 12:44:08	hackygolucky	nice.
2013-12-23 12:44:25	thoward	yeah, really need a decent name
2013-12-23 12:44:42	thoward	i dont' want to call it "kids" anything
2013-12-23 12:45:14	__love__	Young Coders was the python-for-kids session last year
2013-12-23 12:45:30	hackygolucky	ah, cool.
2013-12-23 12:48:40	hackygolucky	thoward: so ideally would you ever want everyone in the same space?

2013-12-23 12:53:15	hackygolucky	thoward: also, with workshops, are you intending on doing the mikael-style where it is everyone experiencing the same workshop at different times?
2013-12-23 12:53:44	thoward	hackygolucky: yeah, maybe. for like, keynote style things, etc. anytime there's a need to address the entire crowd at once.
2013-12-23 12:53:52	thoward	also, lunch and other activities
2013-12-23 12:54:11	JSON_voorhees	pybabies
2013-12-23 12:54:23	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-23 12:54:43	thoward	hackygolucky: not sure yet. i like the mikeal style, but i'm not sure that it's the most efficient.. for example, instead of doing one thing all day, maybe only half day.
2013-12-23 12:55:01	hackygolucky	oh, you don't do it all day
2013-12-23 12:55:06	hackygolucky	each workshop was only 1 hour.
2013-12-23 12:55:17	thoward	well, the presenter did it all day long
2013-12-23 12:55:20	hackygolucky	and you rotate through. Do you mean only doing that format?
2013-12-23 12:55:22	hackygolucky	oh
2013-12-23 12:55:24	hackygolucky	ah
2013-12-23 12:55:25	hackygolucky	yes
2013-12-23 12:55:31	hackygolucky	because that is sane.
2013-12-23 12:56:07	thoward	so my thought would be.. suppose there's 6 hours of presentation time in the day.. perhaps each session happens 3 times in a row, and is 45 minutes long
2013-12-23 12:56:23	thoward	there are three "tracks" (eg, three things happening at the same time).
2013-12-23 12:56:52	thoward	so only 1/3rd of the crowd is in any room at the time, and no presenter would have to give the same talk more than three times.
2013-12-23 12:57:10	thoward	that's still like 66 people in a "class" which is a lot, but not insane

2013-12-23 12:57:35	hackygolucky	that's... a big class.
2013-12-23 12:57:49	hackygolucky	Learning-wise, I think 24 is the sweet spot.
2013-12-23 12:57:53	thoward	yeah. i've taught to classes that size and bigger when i was teaching in china
2013-12-23 12:58:00	hackygolucky	but I also have no idea what is intended with these
2013-12-23 12:58:06	thoward	20-30 is much more manageable
2013-12-23 12:58:11	hackygolucky	the workshops at NodeConf pushed 30 and it was overwhelming
2013-12-23 12:58:21	hackygolucky	there wasn't enough help for some of them.
2013-12-23 12:58:27	thoward	i see
2013-12-23 12:58:36	hackygolucky	speaking as a newer programmer.
2013-12-23 12:58:38	thoward	maybe what's needed are more coaches/teachers aids
2013-12-23 12:58:44	hackygolucky	yes.
2013-12-23 12:58:46	hackygolucky	that too.
2013-12-23 12:58:59	thoward	didnt some of the workshops at nodeconf have multiple presenters?
2013-12-23 12:59:09	hackygolucky	almost all of them did.
2013-12-23 12:59:19	hackygolucky	I think they were all pairs.
2013-12-23 12:59:25	hackygolucky	and some had one more.
2013-12-23 12:59:48	hackygolucky	did you follow the thread for when they were organizing the nodecopter workshop?
2013-12-23 12:59:52	hackygolucky	Logistical nightmare.
2013-12-23 13:00:08	hackygolucky	still worked out though.
2013-12-23 13:00:16	hackygolucky	the budget for it was kinda crazy.
2013-12-23 13:00:19	thoward	nah, i missed out on almost the entire thing, and only really heard about nodeconf afterwards.
2013-12-23 13:00:41	hackygolucky	I read through it when I first jumped in on the nodebots stuff.
2013-12-23 13:00:44	thoward	why was the budget high?
2013-12-23 13:01:02	thoward	i mean you need lots of copters, and they are expensive.
2013-12-23 13:01:06	thoward	but other than that..
2013-12-23 13:01:17	hackygolucky	oh shoot, that was the nodebots thing, not nodecopters
2013-12-23 13:01:17	hackygolucky	sorry
2013-12-23 13:01:36	hackygolucky	they bought the sparkfun kits for all participants with a bunch of extra stuff.
2013-12-23 13:01:42	thoward	yup
2013-12-23 13:01:56	hackygolucky	I just mean, for the price you are trying to operate on at NPDX
2013-12-23 13:02:16	hackygolucky	that's not necessary anyway, imho, to have fun with it.
2013-12-23 13:02:30	thoward	well, sponsorship can make up for the rest of that.
2013-12-23 13:03:02	thoward	last year, TBH, we had enough budget to cover some hardware kits and that was the plan, but in the end it was more of a logistics problem than a budget problem.
2013-12-23 13:03:19	thoward	ended up spending the extra cash on other things, but would have rather put it into hardware kits.
2013-12-23 13:04:46	s5fs	yeah planning drones for nodeconf was a challenge
2013-12-23 13:04:50	s5fs	and it was very costly
2013-12-23 13:04:57	thoward	i've said it many times, in ways that sound more adversarial than they should, but i really can't understand the budgets that most other conferences run, and especially as it relates to ticket prices.
2013-12-23 13:06:14	thoward	so, i'm not too worried about budget, as long as i can find enough sponsors at the right amounts.
2013-12-23 13:06:59	thoward	a lot of it, i think is that other organizers don't go out of their way to control costs.
2013-12-23 13:07:29	thoward	for example, first year at nodepdx, coffee and pastries for two days cost $800 from a local supplier. it wasn't great coffee, but it was ok.
2013-12-23 13:07:32	s5fs	could be demanding sponsors too
2013-12-23 13:08:02	hackygolucky	I think being able to do something really cool with hardware at NPDX would be ideal.
2013-12-23 13:08:07	thoward	in 2013, i spent twice that, at 800 per day, for very high quality coffee and pastires. literally some of the best in town, and this is freaking portland.
2013-12-23 13:08:11	Wraithan	hackygolucky: well, this time we already have some kits this time, and we can plan further ahead and not bother with the really expensive kits from sparkfun
2013-12-23 13:08:19	hackygolucky	I think I get uncomfortable relying on the possibility of sponsors covering it all
2013-12-23 13:08:27	s5fs	I still have 20 arduino kits from Mikeal as well
2013-12-23 13:08:31	hackygolucky	while I agree that keeping the ticket price down is essential to the success of NPDX
2013-12-23 13:08:33	thoward	that said, i had *quotes* from tons of caterers that were about 5-10x higher
2013-12-23 13:08:44	hackygolucky	absolutely
2013-12-23 13:08:51	hackygolucky	I have no problem playing hard-ass with vendors
2013-12-23 13:09:03	hackygolucky	I refuse to buy into the notion that shit costs that much.
2013-12-23 13:09:07	s5fs	hackygolucky: haha not sure i'd send you in to play the hard-ass though
2013-12-23 13:09:28	hackygolucky	s5fs: honey vs. vinegar, maybe?  :P
2013-12-23 13:09:38	s5fs	good cop, great cop rarely works
2013-12-23 13:09:45	thoward	but i didn't settle for that. instead, i intro emailed a ton of coffee places, with my budget restrictions (less than $2k), dates, location, and number of people. i actually had two great options to pick from and was able to choose.
2013-12-23 13:09:53	hackygolucky	yup
2013-12-23 13:10:19	Wraithan	I can mess up my hair and growl when they say a price that is too high
2013-12-23 13:10:24	thoward	it's all about anchoring the discussion.
2013-12-23 13:10:25	hackygolucky	there's always an up-and-coming vendor willing to take the job. Oftentimes the hunger driving them results in a quality you don't get from the standards.
2013-12-23 13:10:32	s5fs	Wraithan: that  was pretty much my plan
2013-12-23 13:10:33	Wraithan	good cop/insane dude
2013-12-23 13:10:43	hackygolucky	thoward: absolutely.
2013-12-23 13:10:45	s5fs	bad cop / insane hacker
2013-12-23 13:10:46	thoward	Wraithan: can i book you for NPDX negotiations?
2013-12-23 13:10:52	Wraithan	thoward: haha
2013-12-23 13:11:01	hackygolucky	s5fs: you'd be surprised how hard I went with negotiations for the wedding.
2013-12-23 13:11:17	hackygolucky	Oh, you want it for that price? NO ONE does it for that price. Bullshit.
2013-12-23 13:11:19	hackygolucky	And I got hit.
2013-12-23 13:11:36	Wraithan	hit?
2013-12-23 13:11:40	Wraithan	like a person hit you?
2013-12-23 13:11:40	hackygolucky	because it is wasteful. I'm not going to allocate/stretch resources because you're telling me I need to do something silly.
2013-12-23 13:11:53	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-23 13:11:55	hackygolucky	oops, no
2013-12-23 13:11:55	hackygolucky	it
2013-12-23 13:11:57	Wraithan	haha
2013-12-23 13:12:03	thoward	hackygolucky: re up-and-coming yes, this exactly. mutual benefit is awesome. new vendor needs exposure/opportunity/experience, we provide that, and get great price and quality in return. win/win.
2013-12-23 13:12:04	s5fs	*whap*
2013-12-23 13:12:07	Wraithan	'I was negotiating so hard a person hit me'

2013-12-23 13:17:05	thoward	hackygolucky: not really. previously i've done organizing via basecamp. not sure if i'm going to use that again this year or not.
2013-12-23 13:17:17	s5fs	if we can estimate attendees i may be able to borrow gear or get him to donate time

2013-12-23 13:23:07	s5fs	thoward: my guy is still in hawaii, when he returns i'll find out about his availability and whatnot.

2013-12-23 13:23:20	hackygolucky	I've been to too many conferences now where they run out of drip coffee in the morning.
2013-12-23 13:23:39	thoward	hackygolucky: i agree. i always bring this up with coffee vendors.
2013-12-23 13:23:40	hackygolucky	I'd rather have endless drip coffee than run out of drip and wait 20 minutes in line for a pour-over
2013-12-23 13:23:52	s5fs	i say we just go drip coffee
2013-12-23 13:24:17	thoward	i like the upgrade option, during certain windows of time.
2013-12-23 13:24:23	hackygolucky	especially at conferences, when I'm endlessly sleep-deprived
2013-12-23 13:24:27	Wraithan	I'm fine with a fancy option, but if I am going for coffee, then I am usually aiming for some quick drip
2013-12-23 13:24:46	hackygolucky	thoward: for people who dig that, upgrade is awesome. I just mean prioritizing the drip.
2013-12-23 13:24:52	hackygolucky	which you seem to agree with.
2013-12-23 13:24:54	hackygolucky	so yay!
2013-12-23 13:24:55	Wraithan	thoward: I don't know how competitive it is, but there are multiple places in town that sell cold brew by the growler,
2013-12-23 13:25:01	thoward	ristretto, at NPDX 2013, only did pour-overs during certain break periods. otherwise, their focus was keeping urn-coffee stocked, which was all french-press made.

2013-12-23 13:25:09	thoward	i don't think i ever saw them run out.
2013-12-23 13:25:26	hackygolucky	thoward: yeah, you guys totally got it right at NPDX

2013-12-23 16:16:59	thoward	s5fs: it's not any nastier than any other breaded chicken product at a fast food place, really.

2013-12-23 16:17:08	s5fs	thoward: i don't eat that shit haha

2013-12-27 13:55:40	Wraithan	And stickers are far easier to give away compared to business cards so I can see going through 500 pretty easily
2013-12-27 13:56:06	Wraithan	also they are stickers so I loves them
2013-12-27 13:56:20	Wraithan	I look forward to seeing what design we pick for pdxnode
2013-12-27 13:56:23	justinabrahms	hah. I love the thought of having personal stickers instead of business cards.
2013-12-27 13:56:45	Wraithan	justinabrahms: did you look at their offerings to find that
2013-12-27 13:57:02	Wraithan	it is actually business card worthy stock that they use for those
2013-12-27 13:57:04	Wraithan	super rad
2013-12-27 13:57:10	justinabrahms	Wraithan: just riffing on "stickers are easier to give away than business cards"
2013-12-27 13:57:33	justinabrahms	and I just picture having a little justinabrahms face on a sticker w/ my twitter handle & email to hand out instead of a business card.
2013-12-27 13:57:33	Wraithan	justinabrahms: oh, stickerobot has them
2013-12-27 13:57:50	Wraithan	the back can be used as a regular business card after the sticker is taken off
2013-12-27 13:57:55	Wraithan	and you can print on both sides of the backing
2013-12-27 13:58:13	justinabrahms	link?
2013-12-27 13:58:22	Wraithan	justinabrahms: http://stickerobot.com/order/
2013-12-27 13:58:39	Wraithan	250 run of business card stickers with back printing is only 107
2013-12-27 13:58:49	Wraithan	that is actually competitive with other business card places honestly
2013-12-27 13:58:56	Wraithan	and they don't include a sticker
2013-12-27 13:59:24	hackygolucky	gosh darnit
2013-12-27 13:59:31	Wraithan	hackygolucky: ?
2013-12-27 13:59:32	hackygolucky	somebody took knode.io on twitter
2013-12-27 13:59:49	hackygolucky	I apparently didn't sign up for it when I locked in the url
2013-12-27 14:00:05	hackygolucky	and hilariously, they have our url listed as their product.
2013-12-27 14:00:14	Wraithan	lol
2013-12-27 14:00:17	justinabrahms	looks like they might have had knode.io in 2012?
2013-12-27 14:00:27	justinabrahms	their tweets are old.
2013-12-27 14:00:40	hackygolucky	sucks for them.
2013-12-27 14:00:55	hackygolucky	I wonder if there's a way for me to get that twitter acct.
2013-12-27 14:01:02	justinabrahms	you should email twitter support (or use contacts if you have any) to see if you can get access, citing that you own the domain.
2013-12-27 14:06:29	phated	justinabrahms: hackygolucky: twitter support won't do anything, have to backchannel twitter employees
2013-12-27 14:06:37	hackygolucky	gah
2013-12-27 14:06:49	justinabrahms	you might consider tweeting "Do I know any twitter employees?"
2013-12-27 14:07:10	 *	justinabrahms <3's parameterized tests.
2013-12-27 14:07:22	Wraithan	The only twitter employee I know in town isn't on IRC right now
2013-12-27 14:07:38	Wraithan	hackygolucky: https://twitter.com/secretasianman
2013-12-27 14:07:43	Wraithan	pdx twitter hacker
2013-12-27 14:08:55	hackygolucky	!m Wraithan
2013-12-27 14:08:55	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work Wraithan!
2013-12-27 14:09:39	Wraithan	hackygolucky: and there was that dude at cascadia who worked at twitter who gave the clustering talk
2013-12-27 14:09:54	hackygolucky	oh, yeah. I totally zoned out during his talk :-/
2013-12-27 14:11:24	Wraithan	I chatted with him a bit at a cocktail bar later that night after his talk
2013-12-27 14:11:32	Wraithan	during the hacker olympics
2013-12-27 14:13:47	hackygolucky	ah
2013-12-27 14:14:15	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, the opensourcery business cards (for the devs) are stickers... they're pretty cool but once you peel off the sticker part your reflex is to throw away the backing (the actual biz card)
2013-12-27 14:16:25	adamdicarlo	whoa, print on both sides of the backing? that's neat.. the OS ones don't have that..
2013-12-27 14:16:34	adamdicarlo	that might mitigate the reflex
2013-12-27 14:19:04	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: yeah possibly
2013-12-27 14:21:40	adamdicarlo	I never thought it was a big deal though, just something funny I noticed the first time I peeled one of my own cards
2013-12-27 14:21:56	adamdicarlo	so I'd tell people about that when giving them a card and get a chuckle
2013-12-27 14:22:20	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: nice
2013-12-27 14:22:38	Wraithan	I think if I had a company logo, I'd do that

2013-12-30 12:09:50	Wraithan	Well, and the blatant false information in their response blog post
2013-12-30 12:11:27	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-30 12:12:44	JSON_voorhees	Wraithan: yep...
2013-12-30 12:16:27	hackygolucky	I love that this happens the week I was going to ask organizers about hosting on DO or Nodejitsu...
2013-12-30 12:17:33	jden	protip: don'
2013-12-30 12:17:46	jden	t store credentials on persistent block storage in any case
2013-12-30 12:18:10	phated	always store credentials
2013-12-30 12:18:25	phated	horse_jden: store credentials on persistent block storage
2013-12-30 12:19:35	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-30 12:20:32	jden	horse_jden: your passwords should be wooden alphabet blocks
2013-12-30 12:20:42	phated	where do you store credentials?
2013-12-30 12:21:49	justinabrahms	12factor suggests passwords live in environment files, managed by something like a chef.
2013-12-30 12:22:03	jden	in memory, pushed from config stores
2013-12-30 12:22:09	jden	^ that
2013-12-30 12:22:44	phated	2 of those words made sense to me
2013-12-30 12:23:39	jden	when provisioning a new service, it connects to a configuration service, downloads configuration, incl credentials, and launches the service processes with env variables
2013-12-30 12:23:48	jden	none of this is written to disk
2013-12-30 12:24:33	phated	wouldn't they be stored on disk at the configuration service?
2013-12-30 12:24:59	jden	process isolation is still a potential weakness on the vm, i gues
2013-12-30 12:25:05	jden	yeah, encrypted
2013-12-30 12:25:29	phated	what is an example of a configuration service
2013-12-30 12:26:42	jden	in our case it's a python script running via a rest interface. when we go to spin up a new service instance, we generate a one-time use token which that service uses to authenticate to the config service. then it's just a rest request which downloads a json file with all the config stuff
2013-12-30 12:26:55	jden	i've seen examples that get more elaborate
2013-12-30 12:28:08	jden	we kind of based some of the idea on http://www.gazzang.com/products/ztrustee
2013-12-30 12:28:17	jden	which is a commercial product
2013-12-30 12:32:50	phated	cool
2013-12-30 12:35:12	justinabrahms	http://12factor.net/config
2013-12-30 12:36:37	phated	justinabrahms: yeah, i had never heard of 12factor before, looked it up
2013-12-30 12:37:04	justinabrahms	As with all manifestos, it's super valuable even if you don't agree with it, because it allows you to point to something and say why you disagree.
2013-12-30 12:37:12	justinabrahms	eg: a straw man to reference.
2013-12-30 12:38:43	phated	i typically use env vars but i didn't know how people got them to their instances

2013-12-30 13:29:14	AWinterm_	I really don't understand why everyone hates callbacks
2013-12-30 13:29:17	AWinterm_	they're just functions!

2013-12-30 13:29:58	justinabrahms	AWinterm_: deeply nested callbacks can be difficult to follow.
2013-12-30 13:30:08	AWinterm_	justinabrahms: so don't nest em :P
2013-12-30 13:30:28	justinabrahms	:)
2013-12-30 13:30:29	AWinterm_	also we have streams for that kind of thing
2013-12-30 13:30:53	AWinterm_	also I really hate the function*() syntax
2013-12-30 13:31:07	AWinterm_	I put a * in it, so now it behaves *completely* differently
2013-12-30 13:31:18	justinabrahms	just like = and == or !=
2013-12-30 13:31:24	justinabrahms	1 extra character, crazy different. ;)
2013-12-30 13:31:27	AWinterm_	heh
2013-12-30 13:31:35	AWinterm_	well, you're still calling it a function
2013-12-30 13:31:44	AWinterm_	why not just add a keyword?
2013-12-30 13:31:47	AWinterm_	generator?
2013-12-30 13:31:51	AWinterm_	or something

2013-12-30 13:32:16	justinabrahms	AWinterm_: just don't use `function` anymore, preferring instead the arrow syntax.
2013-12-30 13:32:23	justinabrahms	problem solved. hah!
2013-12-30 13:32:25	AWinterm_	!m justinabrahms

2013-12-30 13:32:26	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work justinabrahms!
2013-12-30 13:44:09	jden	koa looks interesting. i've been kind of neutral on generators thus far
2013-12-30 13:45:01	jden	i think a better Enumerable abstraction would be more useful, which could support infinite Enumerables or what have you
2013-12-30 13:47:18	AWinterm_	jden: I really don't think it needs to be language feature
2013-12-30 13:47:28	AWinterm_	javascript already has for, if, and function closure. What else do you want?
2013-12-30 13:47:35	AWinterm_	Get off my lawn!

2013-12-30 13:57:25	 *	AWinterm_ didn't know that was an issue
2013-12-30 13:58:43	jden	looping is just a special case of recursion
2013-12-30 13:59:28	AWinterm_	jden: yeah, I very rarely use recursion
2013-12-30 13:59:34	AWinterm_	I find it makes code less readable
2013-12-30 14:00:16	AWinterm_	unless I'm parsing a recursive structure, or I can't tell apriori how much work I have..
2013-12-30 14:03:30	jden	it's a reasonable discussion to have, style-wise, but it's an example of something that really has to be supported at the language layer, and imho is a worthwhile feature to have
2013-12-30 14:03:54	jden	"it's an example" = TCO, "it's a reasonable" = recursion, to clarify antecedants
2013-12-30 14:07:06	AWinterm_	jden: yeah, no it makes sense
2013-12-30 14:07:19	AWinterm_	that's a reason to bump to ecma script 6
2013-12-30 14:07:33	AWinterm_	I don't really find syntactic sugar like generators or promises compelling
2013-12-30 14:10:10	jden	arrow functions. const/let.
2013-12-30 14:12:40	AWinterm_	arrow functions I'm also kind of meh on
2013-12-30 14:13:36	AWinterm_	I'm also only +0 on let
2013-12-30 14:14:14	AWinterm_	same with const

2013-12-30 16:16:19	jden	it's such a rad venue
2013-12-30 16:16:24	hackygolucky	hrm, 300?
2013-12-30 16:16:43	hackygolucky	it's fairly affordable considering your lodging and food are included with the bunk ticket
2013-12-30 16:16:48	hackygolucky	if that's how they price it this year
2013-12-30 16:16:51	adamdicarlo	whoa. wow. so i've been to a few week-long camps with ~100.
2013-12-30 16:17:03	hackygolucky	and the ranch itself is sustainable, iirc, and an educational facility for kids.
2013-12-30 16:17:37	adamdicarlo	is it pretty much a normal tech conference...but with giving sessions in lodges/barns/etc... or... ?
2013-12-30 16:17:47	adamdicarlo	unconference?
2013-12-30 16:18:03	adamdicarlo	singing cat stevens and doing hug circles?
2013-12-30 16:18:38	justinabrahms	adamdicarlo: nodeconf was, from what I understand, a bunch of workshops that take place in lodges,etc

2013-12-30 16:22:20	hackygolucky	nope
2013-12-30 16:22:24	hackygolucky	it is very much curated
2013-12-30 16:22:28	adamdicarlo	ah...
2013-12-30 16:22:31	hackygolucky	you are an attendee of all the workshops
2013-12-30 16:22:38	adamdicarlo	oooh....
2013-12-30 16:22:42	hackygolucky	last year, you got a card with numbers on it and a map
2013-12-30 16:22:56	hackygolucky	they were randomized and ended up putting you in a class with 30 people
2013-12-30 16:23:03	hackygolucky	and you didn't know ahead of time what you were doing to do
2013-12-30 16:23:06	adamdicarlo	wow, that's pretty awesome!
2013-12-30 16:23:09	hackygolucky	that way people weren't skipping out.

2013-12-30 16:23:37	hackygolucky	i was a bit skeptical at first. Really, terrified that I would have no idea what is going on as a newer programmer
2013-12-30 16:23:43	hackygolucky	people were super helpful.
2013-12-30 16:24:23	hackygolucky	all of the pdxnode organizers(by happenstance) attended. It was a really awesome way to get to represent Portland.

2013-12-30 16:25:11	adamdicarlo	hehe
2013-12-30 16:25:16	adamdicarlo	how much were tickets?
2013-12-30 16:25:38	hackygolucky	800 included bunk/bathroom/food/conf
2013-12-30 16:25:56	adamdicarlo	cool, that seems reasonable.
2013-12-30 16:26:02	hackygolucky	which I thought was very steep until I've later run the math on ALL other conferences I've attended and had to pay for a hotel.
2013-12-30 16:26:20	adamdicarlo	oh right, yeah...
2013-12-30 16:26:44	hackygolucky	It's such a unique opportunity. I wish there was wiggle room for financial aid to get people there that would normally not have the means/lifestyle to attend.
2013-12-30 16:27:10	hackygolucky	I'm going to try and look into that for CascadiaJS.
2013-12-30 16:27:17	adamdicarlo	huh. I wonder if I'll be able to get my new work to send me to it. i'm starting a new job in two weeks.
2013-12-30 16:27:33	hackygolucky	adamdicarlo: congrats! Are you allowed to say where?
2013-12-30 16:27:38	adamdicarlo	yeah, sliding scale type things are cool.
2013-12-30 16:28:11	hackygolucky	really difficult to budget for, however.
2013-12-30 16:28:12	adamdicarlo	that's a good question...!
2013-12-30 16:28:49	adamdicarlo	(thanks! :))
2013-12-30 16:29:57	adamdicarlo	maybe i'll wait on that, but i'm staying in portland :)
2013-12-30 16:30:44	hackygolucky	woohoo! As it should be...
2013-12-30 16:31:02	adamdicarlo	heckyeah.
2013-12-30 16:32:09	hackygolucky	so adamdicarlo, when are you going to give a talk at pdxnode?
2013-12-30 16:32:10	hackygolucky	:D
2013-12-30 16:32:21	adamdicarlo	another good question!
2013-12-30 16:32:41	adamdicarlo	i missed last meeting cuz I was sick :(
2013-12-30 16:33:14	adamdicarlo	but I wrote a (hacky) program recently that automates something silly for me that i could maybe talk about....
2013-12-30 16:33:41	adamdicarlo	and wow am I glad I wrote it in node
2013-12-30 16:33:54	justinabrahms	my interest is piqued.
2013-12-30 16:33:59	justinabrahms	Will it solve a problem for me too?
2013-12-30 16:34:02	adamdicarlo	because it was super fun and pretty darn easy.
2013-12-30 16:34:29	adamdicarlo	justinabrahms, depends on if you USE the NETwork so rarely spoken about these days.
2013-12-30 16:34:45	justinabrahms	adamdicarlo: alas, I do not.
2013-12-30 16:35:30	adamdicarlo	hmm, do these talks get recorded? <_<  ... >_>
2013-12-30 16:35:49	justinabrahms	I don't think so.
2013-12-30 16:36:03	justinabrahms	nearly falling asleep in starbucks right now. So tired. :-p
2013-12-30 16:36:27	adamdicarlo	first day back from holidays?
2013-12-30 16:36:49	justinabrahms	no, just not enough sleep
2013-12-30 16:38:01	 *	adamdicarlo nods
2013-12-30 16:38:03	__love__	justinabrahms: one weird trick: go to bed
2013-12-30 16:38:22	hackygolucky	heh
2013-12-30 16:38:43	hackygolucky	adamdicarlo: we hope to record them eventually. Worst case is that we really could just use someone's laptop but I never remember to do that.
2013-12-30 16:39:22	adamdicarlo	ah, yeah.
2013-12-30 16:40:00	adamdicarlo	well i guess either way, i'll just present my project as the Big Buck Bunny downloader
2013-12-30 16:41:47	jden	i actually really like the laptop approach, because 1) the quality is surprisingly good, 2) it doesn't require special equipment (beyond what we already have), and 3) you can you youtube livestreaming/archiving, and not have to worry about editing stuff later
2013-12-30 16:42:08	hackygolucky	oh, interesting.
2013-12-30 16:42:19	jden	you can you = you can use
2013-12-30 16:54:43	justinabrahms	Hackygolucky: we had a setup like that at djangonyc. I can give you all the info on that layer if you want.
2013-12-30 16:55:05	justinabrahms	Later even

2013-12-31 15:50:10	JSON_voorhees	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2013-12-31 17:20:28	phated	jden: bluebird looks so awesome
2013-12-31 17:21:48	jden	things i like about bluebird: it implements the DOM Promise api, and it's fast enough that it completely disarms a whole class of arguments against promises
2013-12-31 17:22:31	phated	things i like about bluebird: custom builds, wiki posts explaining promise anti-patterns
2013-12-31 17:22:44	phated	promisifyAll
2013-12-31 17:23:52	phated	jden: an anti-pattern it mentions is deferreds
2013-12-31 17:25:56	phated	things i like about bluebird: Promise.bind
2013-12-31 17:27:01	justinabrahms	jden: bluebird?
2013-12-31 17:27:13	phated	justinabrahms: promises a+ library
2013-12-31 17:27:20	phated	justinabrahms: https://npmjs.org/package/bluebird
2013-12-31 17:28:03	justinabrahms	how does it compare to when?
2013-12-31 17:29:12	phated	justinabrahms: i am almost ready to throw when out the window
2013-12-31 17:29:20	justinabrahms	jden: I found cljs not a good fit for chrome extensions b/c you have to play with so many external apis
2013-12-31 17:29:38	justinabrahms	but, I also wasn't terribly motivated to learn new tech (preferring to get something done)
2013-12-31 17:31:51	phated	things i like about bluebird: promise.filter
2013-12-31 17:32:47	justinabrahms	phated: if you want a place to experiment with bluebird on a small code base, tweach is like 200 LOC and uses when
2013-12-31 17:32:51	justinabrahms	when.all, when/apply, etc
2013-12-31 17:37:02	justinabrahms	jden: I'd use cljs again, though. I need more time with it, I think.

2013-12-31 17:58:39	othiym23	the only way it could be done is via some pretty gross monkeypatching that would probably cause as many problems as it would solve

2014-01-01 18:26:03	hackygolucky	It'd still make an EXCELLENT npm hook
2014-01-01 18:26:34	Wraithan	dlmanning: chrisdickinson and erkstyn were walking out of the theater at the same time Eva and I were. So the accidentally and together are the pairing in that sentence

2014-01-01 18:27:51	hackygolucky	hrm. As in removing it and making it a separate thing?
2014-01-01 18:28:04	hackygolucky	or just vaporizing it?

2014-01-01 18:28:16	phated	separating it

2014-01-01 18:29:20	hackygolucky	not ideal but doable
2014-01-01 18:29:26	phated	could set up a pre-commit hook locally
2014-01-01 18:29:27	hackygolucky	and will most likely be hacky

2014-01-01 19:49:56	Wraithan	Looking for some completely biased opinions here: Thinking about finally learning a front end framework for a little app I have in mind, backbone and angular appear to be equally common for the contracts that I've been doing so what do folks think/recommend?

2014-01-01 20:00:41	dlmanning	backbone does less but gives you more flexibility
2014-01-01 20:02:45	dlmanning	It's pretty silly in the grand scheme of things, but I really don't like having to use the data- html attributes for binding
2014-01-01 20:02:56	dlmanning	So backbone +1

2014-01-02 14:52:08	scottjab	he said "super basic"
2014-01-02 14:52:26	justinabrahms	scottjab: does he know javascript or programming at all?
2014-01-02 14:52:40	scottjab	he knows very little python
2014-01-02 14:52:55	scottjab	and I think 2000 era JS
2014-01-02 14:54:03	justinabrahms	I got http://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Node-js-JavaScript-Everywhere-Magazine/dp/1119962595 for hackygolucky. She can say whether she liked it.
2014-01-02 14:54:04	scottjab	he inherted a test runner written in node
2014-01-02 14:54:22	justinabrahms	I think it might have been a tad out of date, but goes over some fun projects

2014-01-02 14:55:21	hackygolucky	effective js isn't a how to learn programming
2014-01-02 14:55:27	Wraithan	No it isn't
2014-01-02 14:55:30	hackygolucky	it's a get better at javascripting
2014-01-02 14:55:40	hackygolucky	oh, yeah
2014-01-02 14:55:42	Wraithan	Which is why I said refresh and update :)
2014-01-02 14:55:46	hackygolucky	you guys already said that
2014-01-02 14:55:47	scottjab	I think a lot of the beginner JS books are all about jquery

2014-01-02 14:59:26	jarofghosts	there was an episode of nodeup where they mentioned someone ran a js => coffeescript transform on all of node's js and submitted it as a PR

2014-01-02 15:00:16	jden	jsforcats is like, "you have a web browser, lets use it"

2014-01-02 15:27:10	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: that just ends up being the repo for the larger events
2014-01-02 15:27:17	hackygolucky_	it isn't far off from how we're already doing it
2014-01-02 15:27:24	hackygolucky_	meetups is separate, really.
2014-01-02 15:27:36	hackygolucky_	so it is just more content.
2014-01-02 15:27:50	hackygolucky_	though in the long run we'd have that content on our site.
2014-01-02 15:28:16	JSON_voorhees	nice
2014-01-02 15:28:35	JSON_voorhees	I'm up for working with the knode site btw
2014-01-02 15:28:46	JSON_voorhees	but we'll talk about that this weekend
2014-01-02 15:29:04	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: that would be amazing.
2014-01-02 15:29:12	hackygolucky_	I'm kind of swimming in tasks right now
2014-01-02 15:29:19	hackygolucky_	and the sooner the better.

2014-01-02 15:34:27	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky_: I know the feeling, I've been leaving myself free of projects for other people so I can work on my sideprojects for the next couple of months
2014-01-02 15:34:39	hackygolucky_	yes!
2014-01-02 15:34:40	hackygolucky_	well
2014-01-02 15:34:46	hackygolucky_	I'm really excited about knode
2014-01-02 15:34:54	JSON_voorhees	so I finally have time to do some meetup stuff :)
2014-01-02 15:34:59	hackygolucky_	There's just a lot that could -really- be done pretty immediately.
2014-01-02 15:35:07	hackygolucky_	maintenance won't be nearly as tough.
2014-01-02 15:35:12	hackygolucky_	woohoo!
2014-01-02 15:35:38	JSON_voorhees	stoked! I should be able to get started this weekend.

2014-01-02 15:42:37	jden	we should have a ghangout for knode at somepoint

2014-01-02 15:45:03	othiym23	chrisdickinson: did you or Tim ever write down a summary of min-stream and simple-stream and how they relate to each other?
2014-01-02 15:47:19	chrisdickinson	simple-stream was meant to supercede min-streams, iirc
2014-01-02 15:47:33	chrisdickinson	most of his docs *were* on his js-git repo, but they seem to have mysteriously disappeared
2014-01-02 15:47:57	hackygolucky_	hah

2014-01-02 15:57:06	othiym23	chrisdickinson: do you know if he decided simple-streams was a bad idea, or if his attention just wandered, or...?
2014-01-02 15:57:22	chrisdickinson	unsure. i think js-git is still based on it, last i checked
2014-01-02 15:57:25	othiym23	I would just ask him, but I've been invoking his name on #libuv all afternoon with no response

2014-01-02 17:03:57	othiym23	*ES6
2014-01-02 17:04:52	othiym23	there's this thing, which is safer, but (I'm guessing) like an order of magnitude slower because of all the SES hijinx: https://github.com/drses/weak-map/blob/master/weak-map.js
2014-01-02 17:05:09	leofseige	othiym23: can you just use an array for your needs?  var map = []; map[key] = value;?

2014-01-02 17:06:43	JSON_voorhees	i'd never seen ses
2014-01-02 17:06:48	AWinterm_	so it'd be something like this https://gist.github.com/AWinterman/90860f057a335501107a
2014-01-02 17:06:57	AWinterm_	note I haven't tested
2014-01-02 17:07:02	AWinterm_	so there's probably an egregious syntax error
2014-01-02 17:07:11	AWinterm_	even indices of the array is the key for the following odd index
2014-01-02 17:07:14	othiym23	in that case, you're actually attaching an expando onto the Array object, and it'll call toString on the "key" object, so you'll end up with map['[object Object'] = value

2014-01-02 17:08:21	AWinterm_	that is so much text
2014-01-02 17:08:50	leofseige	othiym23: so never override tostring ;)
2014-01-02 17:08:59	jarofghosts	wait am i in #pdxlua
2014-01-02 17:09:15	leofseige	oh wait.. hahah it's not the object uuid
2014-01-02 17:09:58	AWinterm_	othiym23: for some reason that code you posted makes me unhappy
2014-01-02 17:10:33	AWinterm_	I think part of it is this: https://github.com/drses/weak-map/blob/master/weak-map.js#L157-L160
2014-01-02 17:10:40	othiym23	leofseige: var obj1 = {a : 'a'}; var obj2 = {b : 'b'}; var map = []; map[obj1] = 'sanity'; map[obj2] = 'wut'; assert.equal(map[obj1], 'sanity', 'WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?");
2014-01-02 17:10:54	jarofghosts	gopn
2014-01-02 17:11:19	AWinterm_	jarofghosts: just gopn that object
2014-01-02 17:11:22	othiym23	leofseige: ain't no such things as object UUIDs in JS
2014-01-02 17:11:22	AWinterm_	it'll be fine
2014-01-02 17:11:26	jarofghosts	'what are you doing later tonight?'
2014-01-02 17:11:30	jarofghosts	just gop'n
2014-01-02 17:11:43	jarofghosts	im going to be getting into some gopn in a pretty big way
2014-01-02 17:11:47	jarofghosts	thats about it
2014-01-02 17:11:52	AWinterm_	eww
2014-01-02 17:11:53	AWinterm_	gross
2014-01-02 17:11:54	AWinterm_	tmi
2014-01-02 17:13:22	jarofghosts	the shorter the variable name, the better the performance duh
2014-01-02 17:13:48	othiym23	leofseige: the other thing to keep in mind is that in that case, you're not actually using the array as an array, you're just attaching a string property to the side of it (which is what an 'expando' is)
2014-01-02 17:13:55	hackygolucky_	I miss just enough of a convo to think 'what the hell is gopn?'
2014-01-02 17:14:00	othiym23	so you might as well just go 'var map = {}'

2014-01-02 17:16:59	AWinterm_	oh, I'd explain the requirement
2014-01-02 17:16:59	othiym23	it's one of the most gratuitous abuses of functional JavaScript I've ever seen
2014-01-02 17:17:02	JSON_voorhees	but "implement this"
2014-01-02 17:17:32	AWinterm_	make me an array implementation of a map, where even indices are keys, and odd ones are values
2014-01-02 17:17:53	JSON_voorhees	AWinterm_: seems straight forward enought
2014-01-02 17:19:03	hackygolucky_	UA js isn't snobby
2014-01-02 17:19:11	hackygolucky_	it is partICular
2014-01-02 17:19:16	JSON_voorhees	:)
2014-01-02 17:19:16	AWinterm_	othiym23: for when .bind isn't available?
2014-01-02 17:19:18	AWinterm_	hackygolucky_: truf
2014-01-02 17:19:19	hackygolucky_	heh
2014-01-02 17:19:44	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky_: I'm a fan after chrisdickinson 's talk 
2014-01-02 17:20:21	hackygolucky_	justinabrahms was only -not- a fan because it was unlike JS he had written and was not easy for him to explain if I was ever having trouble and asking for help.
2014-01-02 17:20:55	othiym23	var bind = Function.prototype.bind; var uncurryThis = bind.bind(bind.call);
2014-01-02 17:21:06	othiym23	I defy you to quickly understand what the hell uncurryThis is doing
2014-01-02 17:21:16	hackygolucky_	ugh
2014-01-02 17:22:19	othiym23	AWinterm_: even / odd object maps are fine in sexpy languages, but if you have objects and constructors, you might as well use them
2014-01-02 17:22:35	AWinterm_	othiym23: I've never had cause to use anthing other than objects
2014-01-02 17:22:36	AWinterm_	for objects
2014-01-02 17:22:37	AWinterm_	:)
2014-01-02 17:23:04	othiym23	just saying, this.keys = []; this.values = []; is a lot easier to work with than a single array
2014-01-02 17:23:32	AWinterm_	othiym23: I mean, it seems kinda silly to not use objects when you want a mapping
2014-01-02 17:23:41	AWinterm_	it'll be a linked list under the hood if its better that way anyway

2014-01-02 17:25:14	othiym23	AWinterm_: now I am confused
2014-01-02 17:25:26	AWinterm_	oh?
2014-01-02 17:25:36	AWinterm_	I wasn't actually advocating for using an even-odd map
2014-01-02 17:25:37	othiym23	my point was that the reason Clojure does things that way is that that way you can use a single simple data structure for your map
2014-01-02 17:25:40	AWinterm_	I just think they're fun
2014-01-02 17:25:55	othiym23	yeah, Clojure(Script) is great
2014-01-02 17:26:00	othiym23	it's just not JavaScript ;)
2014-01-02 17:26:02	AWinterm_	newp
2014-01-02 17:26:07	AWinterm_	javascript is pretty bare
2014-01-02 17:26:43	othiym23	well, it has prototypes and constructors, and Clojure has protocols and a MUCH BETTER collection API
2014-01-02 17:27:12	leofseige	othiym23: TIL.  i've been using jquery as a crutch so long i keep being surprised at how bare bones js is
2014-01-02 17:27:50	chrisdickinson	aaaactually...
2014-01-02 17:27:59	chrisdickinson	arrays don't necessarily become linked lists under the hood
2014-01-02 17:28:05	chrisdickinson	or at least, if they do, sometimes they do it wrong and you're better off just using a linked list at the JS layer (for situations where you're shifting/popping lots of items)

2014-01-02 17:29:17	AWinterm_	chrisdickinson: but objects often are, if you use them like an iterable
2014-01-02 17:29:21	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorhees: i've been meaning to write more about UA JS, but ... that thing where I don't do things I should do and instead do dumb things keeps happening
2014-01-02 17:29:38	JSON_voorhees	it's hard
2014-01-02 17:30:16	chrisdickinson	AWinterm_: hm. was under the impression they'd be hash map to (likely) linked lists of same-hashed properties
2014-01-02 17:30:47	jden	chrisdickinson: i hate it when that happens
2014-01-02 17:30:50	chrisdickinson	oh, there was a great explanation of how python did this on the internets.
2014-01-02 17:31:06	AWinterm_	chrisdickinson: oooooo
2014-01-02 17:31:09	AWinterm_	oooo that's different
2014-01-02 17:31:12	AWinterm_	oooo
2014-01-02 17:31:12	chrisdickinson	http://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-dictionary-implementation/
2014-01-02 17:31:30	AWinterm_	ah yes, I think I remember this
2014-01-02 17:32:05	AWinterm_	oh, no
2014-01-02 17:32:19	AWinterm_	what I'm thinking of was some guy who was arguing for instantiating a class rather than a dictionary
2014-01-02 17:32:31	AWinterm_	for performance reasons?
2014-01-02 17:32:35	 *	AWinterm_ doesn't remember
2014-01-02 17:32:41	othiym23	chrisdickinson, AWinterm_: it depends on the implementation, and there's probably a linked list in there *somewhere* due to the ES6 requirement that iteration order be the same as addition order for object properties
2014-01-02 17:32:57	othiym23	*that* is super stupid, but it's what TC39 has decreed, and it will be so
2014-01-02 17:33:02	AWinterm_	meh
2014-01-02 17:33:13	AWinterm_	I'm still not going to rely on an ordering for those elements
2014-01-02 17:33:21	othiym23	they claim to have an implementation that's actually faster than using hash buckets
2014-01-02 17:33:36	othiym23	AWinterm_: that's sane, because in ES < 6, order isn't guaranteed
2014-01-02 17:33:41	othiym23	that's a change they made for ES6
2014-01-02 17:33:57	othiym23	and now they're talking about extending it to Sets and Maps, which makes me go @_@
2014-01-02 17:34:15	jden	ordered sets :/
2014-01-02 17:34:20	chrisdickinson	ah interesting, i didn't realize they actually defined iteration order :|
2014-01-02 17:34:46	chrisdickinson	es6 keeps gaining new and interesting features
2014-01-02 17:34:46	othiym23	chrisdickinson: http://esdiscuss.org/topic/additional-set-prototype-methods / https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jorend/Deterministic_hash_tables
2014-01-02 17:34:50	chrisdickinson	(tco as well!)
2014-01-02 17:34:59	othiym23	"new" and "interesting" is how I'd put it
2014-01-02 17:35:29	chrisdickinson	i am a star wars nerd, and the apocrypha behind es6/harmony astounds me
2014-01-02 17:35:31	othiym23	I keep meaning to wade into things on es-discuss more, but there's enough noise and well-intentioned crankitude on there as it is
2014-01-02 17:36:40	othiym23	I try to avoid following language standardization efforts because they're so maddening, but for whatever reason I feel like I hae a stake in the outcome of ES6 so I keep a close eye on it
2014-01-02 17:36:59	othiym23	there are at least a couple things that happen per week that intellectually offend me
2014-01-02 17:37:14	othiym23	and there's a revolution time of about 2 months in my opinion of AWB
2014-01-02 17:37:31	chrisdickinson	AWB?
2014-01-02 17:37:35	chrisdickinson	ah
2014-01-02 17:37:40	othiym23	sometimes I can't believe he's allowed to edit the language standard, and sometimes I can't believe what a patient, saintlike human being he is
2014-01-02 17:37:46	chrisdickinson	haha
2014-01-02 17:37:51	AWinterm_	who is AWB?
2014-01-02 17:37:57	othiym23	Allen Wirfs-Brock
2014-01-02 17:38:15	AWinterm_	well, at the very least he is cursed with the name Wirfs
2014-01-02 17:38:22	othiym23	it would be fun to see if you could get him to show up to a PDXNode meeting
2014-01-02 17:38:50	chrisdickinson	ah, he's in sherwood, interesting
2014-01-02 17:38:50	Wraithan	othiym23: he is a cool dude
2014-01-02 17:38:53	othiym23	Ward Cunningham and he are friends from way back, maybe I could apply some indirect peer pressure to get him to come down
2014-01-02 17:39:08	chrisdickinson	that would be pretty rad
2014-01-02 17:39:12	othiym23	Wraithan: I know that Ward thinks the world of him, which is good enough for me
2014-01-02 17:39:17	Wraithan	I know him becausehe is a mozilla employee
2014-01-02 17:39:29	othiym23	my interactions through him are strictly mediated through me watching the hilarious tragedy that is es-discuss

2014-01-02 17:39:54	Wraithan	othiym23: oh yeah, dude is brilliant, I didn't know who he was, and we were talking about language design for a while, was super interesting

2014-01-03 14:59:53	Wraithan	Hah, I'm glad people appreciate him
2014-01-03 15:01:24	jden	!m Wraithan
2014-01-03 15:01:24	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work Wraithan!
2014-01-03 15:06:24	Wraithan	So far I am pretty sure I dont' get backbone at all
2014-01-03 15:06:36	AWinterm_	Wraithan: oh?
2014-01-03 15:06:44	 *	AWinterm_ knows nothing about it either
2014-01-03 15:07:10	Wraithan	It all feels really manual so far
2014-01-03 15:07:13	jarofghosts	its connected to the hipbone, right
2014-01-03 15:07:54	AWinterm_	Wraithan: hmm, call me crazy, but that's probably a good thing
2014-01-03 15:08:27	dlmanning	Wraithan: There's a lot of boilerplate
2014-01-03 15:09:21	jden	Wraithan: it's super manual
2014-01-03 15:09:27	jden	and not in a fun way
2014-01-03 15:09:29	Wraithan	I see
2014-01-03 15:09:32	othiym23	I think front end MVC frameworks will change a LOT as of ES7
2014-01-03 15:09:39	othiym23	the problem is observability
2014-01-03 15:09:46	jden	this
2014-01-03 15:09:53	jden	well, and es6, no?
2014-01-03 15:09:59	jden	or did proxies get pushed out?
2014-01-03 15:10:01	Wraithan	So far I don't see the point other than the model layer, really
2014-01-03 15:10:05	Wraithan	and even that
2014-01-03 15:10:08	Wraithan	I could get rid of
2014-01-03 15:10:14	othiym23	either you have to buy into some kind of all-encompassing abstraction like Angular's injection or Ember's... every thing
2014-01-03 15:10:26	othiym23	or you have to follow convnetions a la knockout and backbone to wire everything togetehr
2014-01-03 15:10:40	Wraithan	I see
2014-01-03 15:11:04	othiym23	jden: proxies and WeakMaps will be super helpful, but without Observers they're incomplete for making terse observable models
2014-01-03 15:12:07	othiym23	has anyone here played around with Om?
2014-01-03 15:12:12	othiym23	https://github.com/swannodette/om
2014-01-03 15:12:18	dlmanning	othiym23: alergic to JSX
2014-01-03 15:12:32	jden	i looked at it and thought it was neat. going over clojurescript stuff before diving into om
2014-01-03 15:13:02	 *	dlmanning was very sad that Object.observe was pushed to ES7
2014-01-03 15:13:05	jden	dlmanning: I'd love to get into it about JSX, but i've got a meating nowish
2014-01-03 15:13:19	othiym23	dlmanning: is there a connection between ClojureScript and JSX?
2014-01-03 15:13:28	othiym23	dlmanning: or were you talking about observers?
2014-01-03 15:13:39	dlmanning	othiym23: I thought om used react
2014-01-03 15:13:41	jden	Om is ontop of react which uses JSX
2014-01-03 15:13:47	jden	on top*
2014-01-03 15:13:50	dlmanning	yeah, that ^
2014-01-03 15:13:52	othiym23	yeah but Om is in ClojureScript, so who cares
2014-01-03 15:13:55	<--	phated (~phated@72.44.240.228) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-01-03 15:14:09	jden	right - as far as I understood, Om does not use jsx
2014-01-03 15:14:19	jden	it has its own binding onto the react virtual dom
2014-01-03 15:14:41	jden	i *guess* it would be possible to make like a cljsx?
2014-01-03 15:14:55	othiym23	it's the persistent data structures and EDN that interest me more than the fast DOM stuff
2014-01-03 15:14:56	jden	but there's no need to in a lisp
2014-01-03 15:15:11	jden	othiym23: this
2014-01-03 15:15:14	dlmanning	I confess I just saw that react was involved and didn't look much more closely
2014-01-03 15:21:37	dlmanning	Anyway, according to this guy it makes "absolutely no sense" to render templates on the client: https://twitter.com/LZAntal/status/419242257829486592
2014-01-03 15:21:58	AWinterm_	I wonder if I'm just slow on the uptake, but the learning curve for languages is too high for me to learn a new one just because of the features it offers
2014-01-03 15:22:32	Wraithan	AWinterm_: I just build a thing in the language and usually that doesn't take too long
2014-01-03 15:22:34	Wraithan	a couple days
2014-01-03 15:22:47	Wraithan	I don't learn it well enough to make informed decision
2014-01-03 15:22:56	AWinterm_	heh
2014-01-03 15:23:04	AWinterm_	I've been pretty focused on JS lately
2014-01-03 15:23:10	Wraithan	Just enough to play with some features
2014-01-03 15:23:12	othiym23	Clojure was easy for me because I've spent so long fucking around with Scheme and elisp (and uh Dylan and CLOS and...)
2014-01-03 15:23:13	AWinterm_	although I still have like no idea what's going on in the browser
2014-01-03 15:23:30	othiym23	languages are easy, deep understanding of abstractions in core frameworks is hard
2014-01-03 15:23:31	Wraithan	othiym23: same, but common lisp and elisp
2014-01-03 15:23:35	-->	jahnreektor (~jahnreekt@66.96.79.211) has joined #pdxnode
2014-01-03 15:23:43	dlmanning	What *is* going on in the browser?
2014-01-03 15:23:52	AWinterm_	mm, I tried clojure for a bit, and felt my mind bending
2014-01-03 15:23:52	Wraithan	shinanigans
2014-01-03 15:23:56	AWinterm_	then I just wrote python
2014-01-03 15:23:56	othiym23	dlmanning: expandos and dunder properties, mostly
2014-01-03 15:23:59	Wraithan	AWinterm_: first lisp?
2014-01-03 15:24:02	AWinterm_	yeah
2014-01-03 15:24:04	Wraithan	ah
2014-01-03 15:24:09	Wraithan	yeah, lisps can be that way
2014-01-03 15:24:24	AWinterm_	I'd tackle it again maybe
2014-01-03 15:24:27	AWinterm_	if there was good reason
2014-01-03 15:24:32	othiym23	AWinterm_: I found 4clojure.com was a great way to learn Clojure very quickly
2014-01-03 15:24:37	Wraithan	haskell or ml-based languages are good for mind bending too
2014-01-03 15:24:51	othiym23	Wraithan: yeah, but they're less applicable to JavaScript
2014-01-03 15:24:57	Wraithan	othiym23: right
2014-01-03 15:25:02	AWinterm_	nice
2014-01-03 15:25:07	Wraithan	just good for a nice mind bending
2014-01-03 15:25:15	othiym23	unless you want to go full robotololita / Brian McCcann and start writing type algebra sugar all over the top of your JS
2014-01-03 15:25:16	AWinterm_	I did haskell and euler problems for a while right after college
2014-01-03 15:25:18	dlmanning	I really like stack-based languages
2014-01-03 15:25:37	othiym23	dlmanning: have you ever played around with Factor?
2014-01-03 15:25:47	AWinterm_	s:euler problems:euler project
2014-01-03 15:25:47	Wraithan	JS is mostly just a lisp with C style syntax and no (real) macros
2014-01-03 15:25:47	dlmanning	othiym23: I have not
2014-01-03 15:26:04	othiym23	it's the closest I've gotten to the power of Neon / Yerk / Mops (in short: OO Forth) on modern OSes
2014-01-03 15:26:09	Wraithan	AWinterm_: I found I learned haskell way better when I tried to apply it to something not purely math related
2014-01-03 15:26:18	dlmanning	othiym23: Looking at its website now
2014-01-03 15:26:24	AWinterm_	Wraithan: that makes sense
2014-01-03 15:26:29	othiym23	Wraithan: JS is the misbegotten offspring of Scheme, Self, and Smalltalk
2014-01-03 15:26:30	AWinterm_	I kind of want to try it for a webserver
2014-01-03 15:26:47	othiym23	with some Java / C line noise thrown over the top at the insistence of Netscape's marketers
2014-01-03 15:27:28	dlmanning	It took me awhile to figure out that javascript wasn't C
2014-01-03 15:27:53	Wraithan	once I realized that it made it so much easier

2014-01-03 15:34:06	othiym23	thanks to JITs, my JS looks very much like C

2014-01-03 15:41:25	othiym23	hackygolucky: nope, I'm only up for Monday and Tuesday
2014-01-03 15:41:33	othiym23	I need to maximimze my home time right now
2014-01-03 15:41:38	othiym23	still sorta exhausted from last year
2014-01-03 15:42:03	hackygolucky	fair.
2014-01-03 15:42:08	hackygolucky	one can hope.
2014-01-03 15:42:10	hackygolucky	heh.
2014-01-03 15:43:58	Wraithan	dlmanning: did you just statically included backfire or did you shim it or ?
2014-01-03 15:46:46	Wraithan	ah, looks like static includes

2014-01-03 15:51:00	Wraithan	Ok, so least fun part of browserify is dealing with modules that don't work natively

2014-01-03 15:53:53	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work justinabrahms!
2014-01-03 15:54:50	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: random things I need I can't use the native version I have to use some person's random customized version or I have to go through a bunch of crap with browserify-shim
2014-01-03 15:55:02	chrisdickinson	ah yeah
2014-01-03 15:55:13	chrisdickinson	going the framework route with browserify is rough
2014-01-03 15:55:14	dlmanning	Wraithan: Yeah, it works just like Backbone.LocalStorage
2014-01-03 15:55:55	chrisdickinson	tbh, for frameworks like that i tend to just include them as script tags outside of my app :\
2014-01-03 15:56:09	Wraithan	dlmanning: right, was more wondering about the browserify side of things, but you went the static include rather than browserify
2014-01-03 15:56:18	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I've come to the same
2014-01-03 15:56:52	dlmanning	Wraithan: Yeah, I think heard substack actually advise that for things that were really written to live in the global namespace
2014-01-03 15:56:55	chrisdickinson	it's a pain, usually it seems like there's some weird overengineering / missing the mark thing going on when frameworks can't be browserified easily
2014-01-03 15:57:20	dlmanning	It's much simply to just link in backbone than to bundle it
2014-01-03 15:58:46	Wraithan	Actually backbone I have working without a problem
2014-01-03 15:59:24	dlmanning	there's some weirdnes with the jquery object iirc
2014-01-03 16:00:05	Wraithan	oh really? I've not had any issues with it, I do have to tack $ onto it before using it (so I do that in a lib folder)
2014-01-03 16:00:21	Wraithan	var backbone = require('backbone')
2014-01-03 16:00:24	Wraithan	backbone.$ = require('jquery2')
2014-01-03 16:00:26	Wraithan	module.exports = backbone
2014-01-03 16:00:46	dlmanning	let me go see what it was...
2014-01-03 16:01:22	Wraithan	Though I have jquery2 in there and I think read that jquery itself should just work now
2014-01-03 16:03:45	Wraithan	yeah, jquery and backbone both work out of box
2014-01-03 16:04:00	Wraithan	switched away from the 'jquery2' pacakge to 'jquery'
2014-01-03 16:04:33	dlmanning	You're using the npm jquery2 package?
2014-01-03 16:04:49	Wraithan	I was, I moved to the `jquery` package and everything works fine
2014-01-03 16:05:07	dlmanning	Oh! They finally updated it
2014-01-03 16:05:10	dlmanning	Nice
2014-01-03 16:05:35	Wraithan	oh hmmm
2014-01-03 16:05:52	dlmanning	Last time I fiddled with it I was using the file straight from jquery.com
2014-01-03 16:05:59	Wraithan	running into one issue
2014-01-03 16:06:44	Wraithan	one change fixes it though:
2014-01-03 16:06:46	Wraithan	var jQuery = require('jquery')(window)
2014-01-03 16:06:56	dlmanning	yeah
2014-01-03 16:07:01	Wraithan	instead of just requiring it, you need to hand it the window
2014-01-03 16:07:04	s5fs	othiym23: beep!
2014-01-03 16:07:07	dlmanning	That was it

2014-01-03 16:07:29	s5fs	othiym23: may I pm?
2014-01-03 16:07:35	othiym23	sure thing duder
2014-01-03 16:09:02	Wraithan	dlmanning: tiny little boilerplate stuff like that I can deal with though
2014-01-03 16:09:02	dlmanning	Wraithan: That option to pass in the window wasn't there before
2014-01-03 16:09:14	dlmanning	Was added 11-07
2014-01-03 16:10:11	dlmanning	Wraithan: So yeah, Backbone mostly just gives you a place to put all the stuff you were gonna write anyway
2014-01-03 16:11:01	Wraithan	https://github.com/wraithan/pokelist/tree/master/vendor
2014-01-03 16:11:21	Wraithan	but backfire and firebase don't have that without resorting to some dude's custom thing :/
2014-01-03 16:11:32	dlmanning	yeah
2014-01-03 16:11:48	dlmanning	No shame in using static links
2014-01-03 16:12:10	Wraithan	right now I don't need an index.html, beefy provides it for me
2014-01-03 16:12:40	dlmanning	Do you know that if you create a skeleton index.html and run beefy with --live it will still autoreload?
2014-01-03 16:12:46	Wraithan	yes
2014-01-03 16:12:52	dlmanning	kk :)
2014-01-03 16:13:02	dlmanning	That's what I always do
2014-01-03 16:13:20	Wraithan	I was avoiding it because I hadn't needed it yet
2014-01-03 16:13:33	dlmanning	Guess you gotta use some dude's thing :)
2014-01-03 16:13:36	Wraithan	and wasn't in the styling side of things yet

2014-01-03 16:29:32	Wraithan	dlmanning: so statically including some stuff but browserifing the rest results in sadness because jquery/backbone aren't available for backfire to modify :/
2014-01-03 16:33:38	Wraithan	yeah, giving up on browserifying all this vendor lib shit
2014-01-03 16:43:53	dlmanning	Wraithan: yeah
2014-01-03 16:44:13	dlmanning	On the plus side, makes it simple to CDN that stuff later
2014-01-03 16:45:06	dlmanning	Wraithan: Although, you could attach the Backbone object to the window from within the bundle
2014-01-03 16:45:18	dlmanning	But by then it's like, what's the point?

2014-01-04 14:08:03	othiym23	aWinterman: probably the best Node websockets (meta-)library to check out right now is 3rdEden's primus, which allows you to plug in whatever lower-level implementation you want
2014-01-04 14:08:27	othiym23	https://github.com/primus/primus
2014-01-04 14:08:43	aWinterman	othiym23: word
2014-01-04 14:08:49	aWinterman	i'll have a look
2014-01-04 14:15:18	aWinterman	right now I'm leaning towards Server send events over http
2014-01-04 14:15:31	aWinterman	I've also been toying with the idea of using not json for serialization
2014-01-04 14:16:40	aWinterman	I might make the whole thing speak protobuf instead
2014-01-04 14:16:40	aWinterman	weird I know
2014-01-04 14:18:32	othiym23	what do you get by using protobuf in the browser?
2014-01-04 14:18:40	othiym23	besides a lot of serialization overhead, I mean
2014-01-04 14:19:04	othiym23	server sent events are a pretty good, underused pattern if you have a relatively small amount of data you're moving around
2014-01-04 14:24:44	aWinterman	othiym23: I'm still kicking the idea around, but it's the common language of every service at UA
2014-01-04 14:24:50	aWinterman	it kind of depends on kafka though
2014-01-04 14:24:56	aWinterman	haven't quite decided how it's all going to work
2014-01-04 14:25:28	aWinterman	othiym23: this is the project, I only just started: https://github.com/AWinterman/kafka-viz
2014-01-04 14:29:43	aWinterman	othiym23: so how much data is a relatively small amount?

2014-01-05 22:27:06	othiym23	phated: if I wrote what Express/Connect is doing that is bad, I a. would not be done for quite some time, and b. would piss off half the Nodeternet

2014-01-05 22:27:36	phated	not *everything* it does that is bad

2014-01-05 22:30:47	othiym23	and how many people thing NODE_ENV is a part of Node itself
2014-01-05 22:36:48	phated	isn't that deprecated?
2014-01-05 22:36:57	phated	wait
2014-01-05 22:37:05	phated	NODE_ENV doesn't default to development?
2014-01-05 22:37:07	phated	>_>
2014-01-05 22:37:10	phated	i fail
2014-01-05 22:37:24	othiym23	NODE_ENV is an Express-ism
2014-01-05 22:37:32	othiym23	it has nothing to do with Node itself
2014-01-05 22:37:43	phated	wow
2014-01-05 22:37:44	othiym23	NODE_DEBUG, on the other hand, is occasionally useful if you're Isaac
2014-01-05 22:37:49	phated	<_<

2014-01-05 22:38:31	phated	it looks like it is also used by PaaSes
2014-01-05 22:38:53	othiym23	if by "PaaSes" you mean "a PaaS" or "Nodejitsu", then yes
2014-01-05 22:39:04	othiym23	maybe forever uses it too
2014-01-05 22:39:13	othiym23	but you won't find it in the Node documentation
2014-01-05 22:40:18	phated	i think heroku uses it too
2014-01-05 22:40:42	othiym23	it's possible
2014-01-05 22:40:45	othiym23	Express casts a long shadow
2014-01-05 22:40:49	phated	but i will move away from it :P

2014-01-05 22:41:12	phated	haha
2014-01-05 22:41:15	phated	not express
2014-01-05 22:41:20	phated	but i think i was using node_ev
2014-01-05 22:41:23	phated	env*
2014-01-05 22:41:23	othiym23	Node isn't *totally* hostile to convention over configuration
2014-01-05 22:41:33	phated	as though it defaulted to "development"
2014-01-05 22:42:00	othiym23	it just bums me out when I have to explain to people the reason that New Relic doesn't use NODE_ENV is because it's not part of Node and they're all "barooo?"
2014-01-05 22:42:56	othiym23	here's my stab at helping this guy out: https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage/issues/15
2014-01-05 22:43:18	othiym23	super bummed that he got confused enough to think that ns.run and ns.createContext are in some ways equivalent
2014-01-05 22:47:11	phated	i was confused, but never that confused
2014-01-05 22:47:22	phated	you should link to your slides
2014-01-05 22:47:24	phated	they helped a bit
2014-01-05 22:49:35	othiym23	phated: that's a good idea
2014-01-05 22:49:47	othiym23	I should probably revise that deck
2014-01-05 22:49:54	othiym23	I spent at least 15 minutes putting it together
2014-01-05 22:56:25	phated	lmao
2014-01-05 22:56:31	phated	it was pretty good
2014-01-05 22:56:40	phated	even though i think it was CLS and async listener
2014-01-05 22:56:47	phated	which, i still have no clue how to use
2014-01-05 22:56:49	phated	so confusing
2014-01-05 22:59:18	othiym23	asyncListener is probably lower-level than most people need
2014-01-05 23:00:10	phated	but i want to know all the things
2014-01-05 23:00:58	phated	especially after seeing creationix's experiments and talking with chrisdickinson (?) about implementing flask with asyncListener
2014-01-05 23:01:43	othiym23	maybe it'll be clearer after we do the CLS / asyncListener nodeup
2014-01-05 23:02:21	othiym23	also after Trevor finishes the asyncListener rework
2014-01-05 23:02:43	othiym23	(which isn't a huge change, but should make for a slightly more straightforward interface)
2014-01-05 23:10:01	phated	i don't understand the storage part
2014-01-05 23:12:05	othiym23	that's just the state that's getting passed along across asynchronous boundaries

2014-01-06 11:57:51	phated	so...are people just buying the first round of camping tickets, or is everyone trying to get a certain location?
2014-01-06 11:58:29	jden	so, yeah, nodeconf. i want to go, and all, but...
2014-01-06 11:58:38	jden	a grand is a *lot* of money for a conference

2014-01-06 11:58:59	phated	wasn't it 800?
2014-01-06 11:59:02	phated	for camping
2014-01-06 11:59:29	phated	i figured that JSFest is his cheap conf for the year and nodeconf is his expensive one
2014-01-06 12:00:36	jden	was 700, but thats sold out
2014-01-06 12:00:58	jden	the remaining camping tickets in this release have "not jden" restrictions on them
2014-01-06 12:01:20	phated	i figured we would all want to be in the same field
2014-01-06 12:01:27	phated	so i didn't buy a ticket
2014-01-06 12:02:00	chrisdickinson	i think last time i looked the lack of a hotel kind of brought it in line with other conferences i've attended, cost-wise
2014-01-06 12:02:34	phated	i just sleep by the pool at other confs
2014-01-06 12:02:40	phated	no hotel room = win
2014-01-06 12:04:11	jden	i dunno. cascadia in vancouver was less than $500 including hotel and international air fare
2014-01-06 12:05:04	phated	is nodeconf 2 or 3 days
2014-01-06 12:09:34	jden	July 3-6
2014-01-06 12:10:22	jden	screw it. i'm gonna just do it. put it on the credit card now before im forced to figure out what money actually is again. grumble grumble
2014-01-06 12:10:24	s5fs	jden: we could just go camping on the oregon coast and host our own conf
2014-01-06 12:11:01	s5fs	we talked about that over the weekend, hacky suggested we grab recruit speakers that didn't make hte cut and have them speak at our conf, haha!
2014-01-06 12:11:09	s5fs	"B-Squad.js"
2014-01-06 12:11:28	jden	we should *also* do this
2014-01-06 12:12:10	s5fs	seems awesome right?
2014-01-06 12:12:26	s5fs	i have a feel that thoward would totally be into this idea, it seems subversive enough

2014-01-06 12:15:54	phated	should we all go for buckeye meadow?
2014-01-06 12:16:16	jden	it's the only one on sale now that we all could
2014-01-06 12:16:47	phated	buckeye meadow is sold out
2014-01-06 12:16:48	s5fs	I also thought an "Encore" conf would be cool, like a one-day conf the day after a major conf haha
2014-01-06 12:17:29	phated	tickets and planning seem to be a clusterf
2014-01-06 12:17:33	phated	i might just skip it
2014-01-06 12:18:31	s5fs	i guess thats SF money vs everywhere else money
2014-01-06 12:18:38	s5fs	i can't afford $1k + time off work
2014-01-06 12:19:07	jden	fuck sf money

2014-01-06 12:20:34	phated	cuz they probably pay you phx money
2014-01-06 12:20:35	s5fs	2400/mo for a 1br near lake merritt
2014-01-06 12:20:47	jden	i dunno what phx money is, but they pay about boise money
2014-01-06 12:20:48	s5fs	you know lake merritt right? that place you had your car radio stolen like 6x
2014-01-06 12:20:58	jden	heh
2014-01-06 12:21:37	s5fs	jden: how are you surviving on boise money?
2014-01-06 12:22:01	jden	havent made the switchover yet.
2014-01-06 12:22:10	jden	this is why i worked at agile right up until last friday
2014-01-06 12:22:23	jden	lots of other cfa people had the past month or so off, essentially
2014-01-06 12:22:23	phated	i think you are going to have a bad time :P
2014-01-06 12:22:36	jden	nah, it'll work out
2014-01-06 12:22:37	s5fs	I think we should put together a little "support jden supporting america" fund or something to ensure he can get plane tickets to visit fun places
2014-01-06 12:22:44	jden	hahaha
2014-01-06 12:22:50	jden	sure, now accepting sponsorships :)

2014-01-06 12:26:14	jden	international travel is too expensive to justify right now unless someone else is paying for it

2014-01-06 14:32:12	phated	chrisdickinson: all of them should be promises

2014-01-06 14:34:20	phated	chrisdickinson: xhr....another good one
2014-01-06 14:37:19	phated	chrisdickinson: most events are bullshit (in JS at large), if you are binding with .once, then that should be a promise
2014-01-06 14:43:36	chrisdickinson	phated: xhr happens multiple times :)
2014-01-06 14:44:12	phated	xhr load does not unless you are making the same request or reusing the object
2014-01-06 14:44:29	phated	actually, i don't know if you can even reuse the object
2014-01-06 14:44:34	chrisdickinson	you can
2014-01-06 14:44:39	phated	sounds like shitty code
2014-01-06 14:44:41	chrisdickinson	and should in some cases (and shouldn't, in others)
2014-01-06 14:45:08	chrisdickinson	if not reused (in IE<9) it causes a memory leak
2014-01-06 14:45:15	chrisdickinson	(or rather, exacerbates)
2014-01-06 14:45:30	chrisdickinson	xhr *loading* (as in, chunked loading) does happen multiple times
2014-01-06 14:45:42	chrisdickinson	most important dom events happen >1 times
2014-01-06 14:46:13	chrisdickinson	i am okay with streams using promises, but things that are series of events (potentially) should be streams
2014-01-06 14:46:23	chrisdickinson	things that happen once (and once only) should be promises
2014-01-06 14:46:31	phated	chrisdickinson: maybe the talk should be both of those
2014-01-06 14:46:34	chrisdickinson	events that happen once should be apis that are promises
2014-01-06 14:46:38	phated	cuz almost every api should be 1 or the other
2014-01-06 14:46:43	chrisdickinson	(DOMContentLoaded)
2014-01-06 14:46:47	chrisdickinson	yep
2014-01-06 14:46:48	chrisdickinson	agreed
2014-01-06 14:47:23	chrisdickinson	the only exception (and it's a devils advocate thing) is hard-real-time stuff, like web audio, where delaying until next tick to resolve values might be a liability perf-wise
2014-01-06 14:47:52	phated	some webaudio should be a stream, other parts should be promises
2014-01-06 14:52:44	chrisdickinson	phated: i think the working assumption (for domenic's stream proposal) is that streams will be represented as promises
2014-01-06 14:53:33	chrisdickinson	which is concerning for the web audio case, but great for 90% of other cases
2014-01-06 14:56:40	othiym23	I will pay my own way to speak at any Node or JS conferences held on the Oregon as long as they're within 40 miles of Oswald West state park and not in Coos Bay

2014-01-06 14:59:40	JSON_voorhees	woah wasnt node conf dramatically cheaper last year??
2014-01-06 15:00:09	othiym23	chrisdickinson: I think the overhead of promises is so low in the streaming audio case that it shouldn't be a concern
2014-01-06 15:00:31	othiym23	chrisdickinson: streaming audio overhead is still dominated by I/O time most of the time

2014-01-06 15:25:33	jerrysv	othiym23: a lot of sponsorship is going toward more generic javascript conferences
2014-01-06 15:25:59	jerrysv	it wasn't hard to get us to sponsor jsconf 2 years in a row, nor cascadiajs, but not nodeconf or nodepdx
2014-01-06 15:36:17	othiym23	which is funny, because I think the reach of NodeConf is actually higher than JSConf at this point
2014-01-06 15:36:41	othiym23	I'm super excited to be going to JSConf this year, but it's a pretty in-group conference as far as reach is concerned
2014-01-06 15:37:10	jerrysv	othiym23: last year, over 2/3 of the attendees were at their first jsconf

2014-01-07 10:21:26	chrisdickinson	huongs has pho :)
2014-01-07 10:21:38	chrisdickinson	iirc
2014-01-07 10:21:38	hackygolucky	oooh
2014-01-07 10:21:46	nvcexploder	chrisdickinson: what about Mai Pho?
2014-01-07 10:22:00	 *	dlmanning invites himself along
2014-01-07 10:22:01	nvcexploder	I haven't tried huong's
2014-01-07 10:22:12	hackygolucky	ericholscher: so, the pricing makes it sounds like you pay the basic plan, and then pay a fee on each ticket sold
2014-01-07 10:22:18	ericholscher	<3 Huongs
2014-01-07 10:22:21	hackygolucky	but that doesn't make sense to me.
2014-01-07 10:22:45	hackygolucky	or is it that you need to sell enough tickets and if that fees add up to that plan price you aren't paying anything else?
2014-01-07 10:22:56	ericholscher	see my confusion? :)
2014-01-07 10:23:03	hackygolucky	oh
2014-01-07 10:23:06	hackygolucky	keep scrolling
2014-01-07 10:23:06	hackygolucky	heh
2014-01-07 10:23:15	hackygolucky	apparently they confuse a bunch of people.
2014-01-07 10:24:09	ericholscher	but the calculator doesnt take into account the cost of the plan
2014-01-07 10:24:11	ericholscher	?
2014-01-07 10:24:23	phated	hackygolucky: ericholscher: there is a pricing calculator
2014-01-07 10:24:25	phated	use it :P

2014-01-07 10:24:40	hackygolucky	ericholscher: yeah
2014-01-07 10:24:42	hackygolucky	that was my thoughts
2014-01-07 10:24:48	hackygolucky	this is horrible.
2014-01-07 10:24:54	ericholscher	phated: we are all reasonable people
2014-01-07 10:24:55	hackygolucky	phated: have you used the paid plan?
2014-01-07 10:24:56	ericholscher	assume it :P
2014-01-07 10:24:56	phated	haha
2014-01-07 10:25:00	phated	nah, free plan
2014-01-07 10:25:08	phated	because i only run free events
2014-01-07 10:25:10	phated	>_>
2014-01-07 10:25:20	ericholscher	yea, free events are way more simple :)
2014-01-07 10:25:34	ericholscher	this whole money thing is a PITA
2014-01-07 10:25:42	hackygolucky	the fees seem...high
2014-01-07 10:25:46	phated	yeah, ericholscher sponsor money is way easier
2014-01-07 10:27:06	hackygolucky	ericholscher Jerry is going to conjure up Chris Williams in cascadiajs
2014-01-07 10:27:10	hackygolucky	if you want to peek over there.
2014-01-07 10:27:13	ericholscher	fancy
2014-01-07 10:27:44	hackygolucky	he would certainly have experience with it.

2014-01-07 10:29:20	hackygolucky	I need to talk to Chris anyway
2014-01-07 10:29:26	hackygolucky	so I might have to hunt him down/email
2014-01-07 10:29:38	ericholscher	its not a huge deal
2014-01-07 10:29:43	ericholscher	I can also email their support
2014-01-07 10:29:45	hackygolucky	ericholscher: alternatively, you could tweet Carter Rabasa
2014-01-07 10:29:54	hackygolucky	I think he used it for Cascadia
2014-01-07 10:29:59	hackygolucky	but he isn't regularly on irc.
2014-01-07 10:30:27	hackygolucky	if you tweet, he's a quick turnaround.
2014-01-07 10:30:41	ericholscher	they even say to email them to ask about numbers
2014-01-07 10:30:41	ericholscher	so obviously nobody gets it :)
2014-01-07 10:30:41	ericholscher	i'll shoot their support an email
2014-01-07 10:30:43	phated	i think the prices are high because they don't deal with payments, so you end up paying them AND your payment processor
2014-01-07 10:31:01	hackygolucky	:(
2014-01-07 10:33:35	ericholscher	well, i figure their support will be authoritative :)
2014-01-07 10:36:40	phated	their support is amazing
2014-01-07 10:36:52	phated	i've bugged them about a ton of shit
2014-01-07 10:37:18	phated	never >12 hours before response, typically really fast
2014-01-07 10:38:09	ericholscher	phated: ha indeed, they already got back to me
2014-01-07 10:38:48	phated	ericholscher: the platform might still be an infant, but the support is definitely worth it
2014-01-07 10:38:54	ericholscher	hackygolucky: so yea, the credit is free money I guess
2014-01-07 10:40:13	phated	ericholscher: http://blog.tito.io/posts/tito-in-2013-a-look-back-and-a-quick-look-forward/
2014-01-07 10:43:24	ericholscher	though I guess they recoup it when you resubscribe next year

2014-01-07 10:47:08	hackygolucky	so that yearly fee is only if you don't pay them that much in ticket fees?
2014-01-07 10:48:22	ericholscher	na
2014-01-07 10:48:22	ericholscher	you pay that
2014-01-07 10:48:22	ericholscher	get double that in credit
2014-01-07 10:48:22	ericholscher	and pay less % in fees
2014-01-07 10:48:33	ericholscher	but presumably the credit is one time, so next year they get that money back in the subscription fee, but you still pay less % in fees

2014-01-08 00:09:20	hackygolucky	ericholscher: well of course, sir.
2014-01-08 00:11:39	hackygolucky	oh geez
2014-01-08 00:11:58	hackygolucky	is it just more or has substack been especially sassy lately?

2014-01-08 00:14:26	phated	oh no, someone is doing something that isn't substack focused
2014-01-08 00:14:34	phated	might as well throw a fit
2014-01-08 00:14:47	phated	funny thing is, gulp is better than that shit
2014-01-08 00:17:01	hackygolucky	This just... seems a bit silly to put so much work into making fun of something else.
2014-01-08 00:17:16	hackygolucky	No one spit in his bowl of cheerios.
2014-01-08 00:17:27	phated	well, i just did

2014-01-08 00:18:20	hackygolucky	they were particularly silly this evening
2014-01-08 00:18:23	phated	i like the node community, because it means i am going to be rich a long time ;)
2014-01-08 00:18:25	hackygolucky	I lurk, mostly

2014-01-08 10:26:22	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: yeah, yeeeeah. i went through the stackvm backlog and couldn't find substack disparaging anyone personally, just packages
2014-01-08 10:26:56	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: That's true, but I think that's a little bit of a cop-out as a defense
2014-01-08 10:27:13	chrisdickinson	i don't think so. people !== their work.
2014-01-08 10:27:21	dlmanning	No, true
2014-01-08 10:27:23	dlmanning	But
2014-01-08 10:27:45	dlmanning	It's silly to just trash people's work and act surprised when they get offended
2014-01-08 10:28:03	dlmanning	There are more diplomatic ways to have a different philosophy
2014-01-08 10:29:00	dlmanning	On both sides
2014-01-08 10:29:31	hackygolucky	is he required to be diplomatic?
2014-01-08 10:29:37	hackygolucky	this thought occurred to me.
2014-01-08 10:29:40	dlmanning	It's really weird that those are even two sides, because the differences between them are really, really minute
2014-01-08 10:29:49	dlmanning	hackygolucky: No one is require to be diplomatic
2014-01-08 10:29:51	hackygolucky	it would be awesome for him to be, but that isn't a requirement of being a good programmer.
2014-01-08 10:30:36	dlmanning	But like Jimmy Stewart said: "In this world you have to be either very, very clever, or very, very pleasant. I've tried being clever, and I prefer pleasant"
2014-01-08 10:31:12	chrisdickinson	basically, "if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all"
2014-01-08 10:31:20	dlmanning	Something like that
2014-01-08 10:31:50	dlmanning	I've just spent a lot of my life trying to change people's minds by being righter than they were
2014-01-08 10:32:11	 *	chrisdickinson brbs.
2014-01-08 10:32:12	dlmanning	But basically I just ended up depressed
2014-01-08 10:32:33	hackygolucky	I am all about learning why someone doesn't agree
2014-01-08 10:32:52	hackygolucky	in the hopes that I'll understand/agree or at least gain some perspective
2014-01-08 10:33:06	hackygolucky	but that is very hard to do in online arguing
2014-01-08 10:33:10	dlmanning	yes
2014-01-08 10:34:21	dlmanning	But seriously, we're talking about development philosophies that are like vanilla and vanilla bean in comparison to one another
2014-01-08 10:35:01	dlmanning	Meanwhile lots of people are eating Chunky Monkey
2014-01-08 10:36:16	dlmanning	I mean, as we speak people are using yeoman and shit
2014-01-08 10:36:22	dlmanning	;)
2014-01-08 10:41:32	jarofghosts	is it possible to ask what happened without causing it to happen again?

2014-01-08 10:49:09	jarofghosts	dont be a clojerk
2014-01-08 10:49:15	hackygolucky	I don't think arguing on the internet is a bad thing
2014-01-08 10:49:24	hackygolucky	I think getting emotional is.
2014-01-08 10:49:45	hackygolucky	the art of debate is often lost on us.
2014-01-08 10:49:55	jarofghosts	well the problem is civility is hard to convey in plaintext
2014-01-08 10:50:07	 *	hackygolucky nods
2014-01-08 10:50:09	jarofghosts	and every comment gets misinterpreted as an attack
2014-01-08 10:50:10	dlmanning	hackygolucky: Are you familar with the GIFWT
2014-01-08 10:50:18	jarofghosts	and over time that snowballs into an all out war

2014-01-08 10:50:49	hackygolucky	and the googs isn't either
2014-01-08 10:50:50	hackygolucky	ah
2014-01-08 10:51:01	jarofghosts	that combined with black and white thinking leads to terrible terrible times
2014-01-08 10:51:15	hackygolucky	ah
2014-01-08 10:51:20	hackygolucky	yes.
2014-01-08 10:51:54	jarofghosts	yeah thats another piece of the puzzle
2014-01-08 10:54:31	dlmanning	I mean, I used to absolutely love flame wars and internet arguments
2014-01-08 10:55:03	jarofghosts	i like it when either:
2014-01-08 10:55:06	jarofghosts	done playfully
2014-01-08 10:55:07	jarofghosts	or
2014-01-08 10:55:15	hackygolucky	playfully +1
2014-01-08 10:55:22	jarofghosts	when both sides are open to considering the opposition's argument
2014-01-08 10:55:41	hackygolucky	YES
2014-01-08 10:55:42	dlmanning	It's a huge adrenaline surge
2014-01-08 10:55:44	jarofghosts	but then i guess it isnt really a 'flame war' at that point
2014-01-08 10:55:50	hackygolucky	it is perfectly okay for someone to disagree with you.
2014-01-08 10:55:56	hackygolucky	I don't know when that became a thing.
2014-01-08 10:56:06	hackygolucky	someone isn't stupid because they differ in opinion.
2014-01-08 10:56:08	jarofghosts	and if someone is disagreeing with you, why not stop to consider why they are?
2014-01-08 10:56:17	othiym23	"civility" is bullshit: say what you mean clearly, don't obscure disagreement, don't be passive-aggressive, and yell about *things* instead of *people*
2014-01-08 10:56:20	jarofghosts	and if maybe they are 'right' if right is a thing
2014-01-08 10:56:35	jarofghosts	civility in my definition is just avoiding personal attacks
2014-01-08 10:56:42	jarofghosts	attack the idea not the person
2014-01-08 10:56:48	othiym23	(this is why I like people like Ashe Dryden and Shanley)
2014-01-08 10:57:00	dlmanning	othiym23: I think you can express your disagreement while still being civil
2014-01-08 10:57:03	othiym23	online, "civility" is a smarm indicator (to me)
2014-01-08 10:57:04	hackygolucky	I...don't always agree with them.
2014-01-08 10:57:13	hackygolucky	hrm
2014-01-08 10:57:35	hackygolucky	I consider civility the ability to not allow a debate to degrade into personal attacks.
2014-01-08 10:57:47	othiym23	it's David Brooks and Thomas Friedman talking about how we can't have nice things anymore instead of during the good old days of "bipartisanship" (another smarm indicator)
2014-01-08 10:57:50	jarofghosts	well yeah theres a certain level to which some people play the 'im being sane and rational' card as nothing more but a means with which to devalue the other person's position
2014-01-08 10:58:01	hackygolucky	yes.
2014-01-08 10:58:24	othiym23	sometimes people are just being dicks
2014-01-08 10:58:28	othiym23	sometimes people *are* dicks
2014-01-08 10:58:38	dlmanning	and vice versa
2014-01-08 10:58:41	jarofghosts	but i dont think its 'smarmy' to just not lose sight of what the argument is really about and instead take it to a personal level
2014-01-08 10:58:54	othiym23	and if you honestly believe that, either it's time to disengage and go play foosball against yourself for a while, or admit you think they're a dick and not try to pretend to be "rational" about it
2014-01-08 10:59:36	othiym23	I guess my patience with common internet rhetorial dodges is just at a low ebb right now
2014-01-08 11:00:18	jarofghosts	i guess it depends on the goal of the arguers
2014-01-08 11:00:25	othiym23	presume good faith, make your case clearly, know when communication has broken down and it's pointless to continue
2014-01-08 11:00:48	jarofghosts	!m othiym23
2014-01-08 11:00:49	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work othiym23!
2014-01-08 11:00:52	dlmanning	othiym23: Conversely I've seen people use arguments against "tone-policing" as their own rhetorical dodge to justify their being pointlessly rude
2014-01-08 11:00:54	hackygolucky	indeed.
2014-01-08 11:00:56	othiym23	rules in debate are like rules in warfare: once you're past a certain point, they're pointless and probably worse than the problem they're trying to solve
2014-01-08 11:01:22	dlmanning	It's turtles all the way down
2014-01-08 11:01:30	jarofghosts	yeah now were just arguing about arguing
2014-01-08 11:01:31	hackygolucky	dlmanning: that seems to be fashionable as of late.
2014-01-08 11:01:38	hackygolucky	!m #pdxnode
2014-01-08 11:01:39	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work #pdxnode!
2014-01-08 11:02:10	othiym23	dlmanning: I think a good rule of thumb is that you take the limit of an argument being more and more meta, the amount of content in the discussion asymptotically approaches zero
2014-01-08 11:02:46	dlmanning	othiym23: I'd agree with that
2014-01-08 11:03:11	dlmanning	Here's what I see: do you want to communicate or do you want to be right?
2014-01-08 11:03:17	JSON_voorhees	i've been reading nodemon as node-mon for weeks until last night
2014-01-08 11:03:27	othiym23	the list of people I follow on Twitter is filled with feminists and trans activists, and the amount of sophomoric debate-club bullshit social justice activists have to put up with has just made me decide that naked hatred is preferable to "politeness" (quotes intentional)
2014-01-08 11:04:11	dlmanning	othiym23: It's certainly more cathartic, but I don't know if it's accomplishing anyone's goals
2014-01-08 11:04:21	jarofghosts	JSON_voorhees: gotta catch em all
2014-01-08 11:04:27	JSON_voorhees	haha
2014-01-08 11:04:29	hackygolucky	at some point I need a little faith in humanity.
2014-01-08 11:04:36	hackygolucky	all the naked hatred is..
2014-01-08 11:04:36	othiym23	I'm not sure Twitter is a place to accomplish things
2014-01-08 11:04:40	hackygolucky	right.
2014-01-08 11:04:47	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky: like a never-nude?
2014-01-08 11:04:50	hackygolucky	it's a great way for me to get news updates for tech
2014-01-08 11:04:59	hackygolucky	JSON_voorhees: !
2014-01-08 11:05:00	hackygolucky	heh
2014-01-08 11:05:10	dlmanning	othiym23: Then why be an activist on twitter?
2014-01-08 11:05:29	jarofghosts	there are dozens of us
2014-01-08 11:05:30	jarofghosts	DOZENS
2014-01-08 11:05:37	othiym23	dlmanning: for me, I want to hear about people's lived experiences, to support them where I can, and to learn about other people's struggles
2014-01-08 11:06:44	dlmanning	othiym23: Sure, but if being an activist there just invites alot of sophomoric debate-club bullshit that only makes everyone miserable
2014-01-08 11:06:45	othiym23	hackygolucky: I think I may be trying to be a little over-subtle here: I want to have faith in people too, but I'd rather people expose their actual beliefs, no matter how ugly, than hide it behind "polite" or "civil" language that's just dressing up ugliness with fancy words
2014-01-08 11:06:56	dlmanning	It's just hard to see how *anyone's* life is being made better
2014-01-08 11:07:11	othiym23	dlmanning: it doesn't just do that; it's a giant distributed support group too
2014-01-08 11:07:28	dlmanning	othiym23: fair enough
2014-01-08 11:08:10	othiym23	I think Shanley and Ashe have definitely helped change the tone in the tech field, and while the polarization is a bummer, I think that polarization is a natural consequence of everyone being forced to confront divisions that have been papered over for a long time
2014-01-08 11:08:38	othiym23	and the thing about papering things over is that the people who end up hurt the most are the people who are on the wrong side of the power dynamic, generally
2014-01-08 11:08:44	othiym23	aaaanyway
2014-01-08 11:08:46	dlmanning	By the way, I fudged the Jimmy Stewart quote ealier. It's actually this: 'Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, "In this world, Elwood, you must be," — she always called me Elwood — "In this world, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant." Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me.'
2014-01-08 11:08:57	hackygolucky	they are definitely two of many people helping to change the tone.
2014-01-08 11:09:14	othiym23	I'd rather have phated yelling at me than trying to deal with substack's passive-aggressive subgisting, is what I'm really saying
2014-01-08 11:09:26	hackygolucky	I'm not a fan of the way they approach it, to be perfectly honest. I'm still a fan of helping them, however.
2014-01-08 11:09:41	hackygolucky	othiym23: that I can agree with.
2014-01-08 11:09:44	dlmanning	othiym23: On that we agree. Passive-agressive subgisting is bad :)
2014-01-08 11:09:59	dlmanning	and I don't much mind phated yelling at me
2014-01-08 11:10:11	dlmanning	He's pretty funny when he gets worked up

2014-01-08 11:15:02	hackygolucky	sigh, yeah.
2014-01-08 11:15:15	chrisdickinson	it's an illustration that there are other approaches to the problem that don't involve any specific framework

2014-01-08 11:16:29	jarofghosts	but on second thought, reconsidering the alternative...
2014-01-08 11:16:29	dlmanning	yeah he did
2014-01-08 11:16:30	othiym23	chrisdickinson: I think my only real issue with young James is that he can be willfully obtuse about the fact that not everybody in the world thinks exactly like him
2014-01-08 11:16:40	jarofghosts	grizzly man might still be preferable
2014-01-08 11:16:44	othiym23	like, militant prescriptivism is only rarely a universal good
2014-01-08 11:17:09	dlmanning	othiym23: This is a surprisingly common failing among youngish men

2014-01-08 11:19:23	jarofghosts	i thank the god of the internets every night that forums i posted on when i was younger no longer exist
2014-01-08 11:19:33	othiym23	both Jake and James are guys I personally like and who are very smart, and *in person* they're pretty reasonable, but online they seem to flatten out and lose the ability to deal with different worldviews
2014-01-08 11:19:34	hackygolucky	ah yes.
2014-01-08 11:19:35	jarofghosts	lest i be remembered of what a toolbag i was
2014-01-08 11:20:00	hackygolucky	othiym23: I've heard James have some less than stellar arguments in-person as well.

2014-01-08 11:20:10	othiym23	if you know where to look (n.b. I am not going to tell you where or how to look) you can find evidence of what an amusing and delightful fellow I was online all the way back to 1990

2014-01-08 11:34:06	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: i keep having to jump out of this conversation and it makes me saaaad
2014-01-08 11:35:23	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: re: being diplomatic: I waffle. I'd rather hear honest opinions. Being only able to hear positive things or nothing limits my ability to improve
2014-01-08 11:36:05	hackygolucky	I don't think you have to be positive.
2014-01-08 11:36:54	chrisdickinson	& as for the task.js gist -- I don't know many other ways that could be broached usefully -- it's not specifically about gulp (or grunt), it's about the assumption that to do X, you need a framework for X
2014-01-08 11:37:07	hackygolucky	but yeah, I guess I get the point of self-censorship to the point that we're missing parts of an arg
2014-01-08 11:39:40	othiym23	chrisdickinson: I see there being a difference between saying "you don't need a framework to do x" and "using frameworks is automatically stupid"
2014-01-08 11:40:20	othiym23	I personally would never ever choose to use grunt, gulp, or yo, but when I was putting together my talk for Node Summit I started to figure out what people got out of them
2014-01-08 11:40:37	JSON_voorhees	chrisdickinson: can u link me this gist your talking about? I seemed to have missed it
2014-01-08 11:40:55	hackygolucky	JSON_voorhees: cj silverio just retweeted it.

2014-01-08 11:41:05	othiym23	and eventually remembered that I'm an operating systems person and server-side engineer first and foremost, and also bash doesn't scare me
2014-01-08 11:41:09	othiym23	different strokes for different folks
2014-01-08 11:41:21	JSON_voorhees	othiym23: not to go off topic... but do you just use make or something for that stuff?
2014-01-08 11:41:44	JSON_voorhees	also I don't know that I would put yo in with those 2...
2014-01-08 11:42:08	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I don't think civility and politeness prevents the expression of honest opinions
2014-01-08 11:43:31	dlmanning	Rather I think the point of civility is encapsulate dissent in a way that defuses people's defensiveness and makes conversation more profitable
2014-01-08 11:43:42	dlmanning	Or at least, that's what civility *should* be

2014-01-08 11:55:54	othiym23	JSON_voorhees: right now I use make, but eventually I'm gonna need something to run on Windows, and will probably write the absolute minimum necessary pure Node framework I can
2014-01-08 11:56:00	othiym23	or maybe I'll just say fuckit and use gulp, who knows
2014-01-08 11:58:50	chrisdickinson	othiym23: use bashful (i am mostly kidding.)
2014-01-08 12:00:55	othiym23	all I want is something that is fast to develop with, can handle the requirements of our (surprisingly burly) Makefile, and will not make me want to kill myself and / or other people when I try to debug it on Windows over the Azure console
2014-01-08 12:01:35	hackygolucky	yeah, I think the reason I personally had a reaction to James and Raynos' discussion re: gulp was because I know so little of these things that I'd absolutely be likely to use grunt or gulp over what they were suggesting.
2014-01-08 12:01:35	phated	othiym23: the challenge by contra was to create something more pure
2014-01-08 12:01:39	hackygolucky	because I don't know better.
2014-01-08 12:02:16	hackygolucky	and at one point I felt the argument was: these people are crazy! lazy! Why wouldn't they just do what we'd do?
2014-01-08 12:02:29	hackygolucky	Keep in mind: this is me projecting.
2014-01-08 12:02:33	phated	whoa, whoa, whoa, that is happening
2014-01-08 12:02:35	hackygolucky	I'm aware of this.
2014-01-08 12:02:38	phated	i missed a big chunk
2014-01-08 12:02:45	hackygolucky	heh
2014-01-08 12:02:54	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: it's hard to expose "no framework" as an option to beginners
2014-01-08 12:02:59	hackygolucky	right.
2014-01-08 12:03:13	phated	no framework doesn't make any sense unless you only work on 1 thing
2014-01-08 12:03:18	hackygolucky	so when that argument is made at the forefront, I feel like they've told me to take my ball and go home.
2014-01-08 12:03:22	chrisdickinson	phated: i would argue the opposite
2014-01-08 12:03:38	phated	chrisdickinson: then you have no experience as a contractor
2014-01-08 12:03:52	chrisdickinson	oh?

2014-01-08 12:04:41	hackygolucky	phated: that's a bit extreme.
2014-01-08 12:05:04	hackygolucky	You're current work does expose you to these things much more readily.
2014-01-08 12:05:05	phated	hackygolucky: the overhead of reinventing the wheel is not something you put onto you customers, as a contractor
2014-01-08 12:05:08	chrisdickinson	I feel like learning the substrate -- the thing these frameworks are based on -- is ultimately more valuable learning
2014-01-08 12:05:16	othiym23	phated raises a good point, which is that New Relic has been working on refining the same thing for almost 2 years now, so we can / need to spend the time to make sure our tooling has an optimal fit to our problem space
2014-01-08 12:05:23	phated	it's totally fine that chrisdickinson does it cuz he works for 1 company on 1 thing
2014-01-08 12:05:36	chrisdickinson	phated: not using a framework !== not reusing code.
2014-01-08 12:05:52	othiym23	hard to do that as a contractor when you gotta get through a bunch of business reqs and get on to the next gig to make a living
2014-01-08 12:05:59	phated	chrisdickinson: when the client owns the code, that is illegal
2014-01-08 12:06:03	othiym23	see also: Rails
2014-01-08 12:07:01	chrisdickinson	phated: that's kind of an odd argument -- if I am parsing it correctly, you can use other people's other source frameworks, but not use open source packages / create your own open source packages while contracting?
2014-01-08 12:07:33	phated	chrisdickinson: depends on the contract
2014-01-08 12:07:39	othiym23	chrisdickinson: you can't necessarily reuse code you develop for one contract on another -- work for hire belongs to the owner of the contract, more often than not
2014-01-08 12:07:48	phated	othiym23: correct
2014-01-08 12:07:56	othiym23	so yeah, you can use stuff developed outside the bounds of the contract, but you can't pick it up and take it with you
2014-01-08 12:08:03	phated	exactly
2014-01-08 12:08:09	phated	contracting is a crazy beast
2014-01-08 12:08:11	phated	and sucks ass
2014-01-08 12:08:15	othiym23	sure does
2014-01-08 12:08:17	othiym23	not doing that again
2014-01-08 12:08:19	hackygolucky	so you can use open-sourced stuff that already existed?
2014-01-08 12:08:25	phated	of course
2014-01-08 12:08:26	hackygolucky	but you can't make your own while you're on the project?
2014-01-08 12:08:35	phated	hackygolucky: that is subjective
2014-01-08 12:08:36	othiym23	hackygolucky: yeah, actually most corporate IP agreements we sign work the same way
2014-01-08 12:08:58	othiym23	if you're using company resources or doing it on company time, the code you develop belongs to the company
2014-01-08 12:09:02	phated	sometimes the contracts can be structured so you can do it on your own time
2014-01-08 12:09:14	hackygolucky	seems like that would help you keep clients by being able to maintain your OS stuff as part of the stability of your projects instead of having to rely on someone else's stuff.
2014-01-08 12:09:26	phated	yes, othiym23, but i could spend the rest of my life abstracting it, as per chrisdickinson's suggestion
2014-01-08 12:09:38	othiym23	hackygolucky: that's looking at it from a developer's perspective
2014-01-08 12:09:50	othiym23	from a business owner's perspective, they're paying you to create value for people who aren't them
2014-01-08 12:10:03	phated	hackygolucky: most clients pay you to build something and then get rid of you and hire cheaper labor to maintain it
2014-01-08 12:10:14	othiym23	which is, of course, an affront to capitalism, the free market, and little baby Jesus
2014-01-08 12:10:21	hackygolucky	but it is for the good of all programming!
2014-01-08 12:10:22	phated	ongoing maintenance is a pipe dream of mine
2014-01-08 12:10:23	hackygolucky	:D
2014-01-08 12:10:43	hackygolucky	phated: but yeah, I get all these things.
2014-01-08 12:10:50	phated	"blaine, don't have a life because gulp is a bad thing and you should hand write all the things"

2014-01-08 12:13:38	phated	mikeal will give him a free ticket, no doubt
2014-01-08 12:13:44	hackygolucky	phated: dude. He gets into arguments with everyone.
2014-01-08 12:13:46	chrisdickinson	phated: wasn't suggesting abstracting it endlessly
2014-01-08 12:14:36	phated	chrisdickinson: the problem with #nodeppl is that they use abstraction and then act like they don't, and don't contribute to things they don't make
2014-01-08 12:14:51	hackygolucky	phated: you're a good programmer and you have to learn to cohabitate with people that you don't get along with.
2014-01-08 12:14:56	hackygolucky	that, and we like your company.
2014-01-08 12:14:58	hackygolucky	So friggin' go.
2014-01-08 12:15:20	chrisdickinson	phated: that is one way of looking at it
2014-01-08 12:15:39	chrisdickinson	my experience with js suggests that frameworks come and go very very quickly
2014-01-08 12:16:06	phated	chrisdickinson: i would argue the opposite
2014-01-08 12:16:11	phated	chrisdickinson: and that is a problem

2014-01-08 13:31:01	othiym23	because you do it up front and personal!
2014-01-08 13:31:02	othiym23	in the flesh!
2014-01-08 13:31:20	othiym23	the first time I met you you were ranting at me about how wrong I was about everything inside of, oh, I don't know, maybe 2 minutes
2014-01-08 13:32:19	phated	othiym23: substack would have been within 1 minute though
2014-01-08 13:32:24	phated	so i don't understand
2014-01-08 13:35:30	othiym23	that hasn't been what my interactions with substack have been like IRL
2014-01-08 13:35:36	othiym23	mostly we talk about math and Haskell and stuff
2014-01-08 13:40:15	phated	othiym23: he attacked me the minute he walked up to a conversation i was having
2014-01-08 13:40:17	phated	so idk
2014-01-08 13:40:46	phated	i am very much a chameleon personality and mimic the situations or communities i am in at the moment
2014-01-08 13:42:01	othiym23	it probably helps that I work on stuff that substack doesn't care about
2014-01-08 13:44:36	othiym23	I don't mean to suggest that substack isn't at least sometimes socially inept
2014-01-08 13:44:46	othiym23	just that my personal interactions with him have always been chill
2014-01-08 13:45:07	othiym23	and, to get back to your original question, he generally is sorta shifty about disagreeing with people instead of being blunt
2014-01-08 13:45:11	othiym23	I personally prefer blunt
2014-01-08 13:45:39	phated	so that title was an endearing one?

2014-01-08 13:48:37	chrisdickinson	there's a great dirt sandwich cart in the inner SE
2014-01-08 13:48:41	chrisdickinson	handmade, locally sourced dirt
2014-01-08 13:48:51	jarofghosts	bicycle-delivered
2014-01-08 13:49:43	chrisdickinson	sandwich packages are compostable felt sewn together by neighborhood schoolchildren
2014-01-08 13:49:52	chrisdickinson	felt is sourced from local cat hair
2014-01-08 13:51:25	jarofghosts	i hope the cats are cage-free
2014-01-08 13:52:24	jarofghosts	and the schoolchildren, i suppose
2014-01-08 13:52:48	othiym23	free range, responsibly managed and neutered feral cats

2014-01-08 22:12:29	bret	How can I get a bunch of nested async functions return a value for the calling parent function?  Everything I try just returns undefined.  Here is the function that is giving me issues: https://github.com/bcomnes/bretzel/blob/master/models/postIndex/index.js#L18
2014-01-08 22:14:29	phated	buildPostIndex needs to be an async function too (accept a callback) and then call the callback with the data

2014-01-09 13:19:39	hackygolucky	So then we'd have the mock-up ready.
2014-01-09 13:20:13	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: ah, wasn't thinking of puttin' 'em on the shirts necessarily, just the colors
2014-01-09 13:20:55	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: yeah, that's totally fine.
2014-01-09 13:21:09	hackygolucky	the shirt will change slightly anyway depending on price/availability
2014-01-09 13:21:17	hackygolucky	I have very little expectation here.
2014-01-09 13:21:52	chrisdickinson	also we'll almost probably have to modify the logo a bit to bring down the number of colors, I think

2014-01-09 13:41:34	jarofghosts	it doesnt list a color limit anywhere
2014-01-09 13:41:44	jarofghosts	but looks like $25 per color

2014-01-09 13:42:48	jarofghosts	'We wave additional screen fees based on the size of the order. '
2014-01-09 13:42:50	hackygolucky	jarofghosts: cool. thanks!
2014-01-09 13:43:01	jarofghosts	ill assume they mean waive, and not that they wave the bill in your face
2014-01-09 13:43:22	hackygolucky	yeah, I think the price of the shirt will vary on the size of the order.
2014-01-09 13:43:33	jarofghosts	looks like it
2014-01-09 13:43:47	jarofghosts	but number of colors will play a part in it
2014-01-09 13:43:50	hackygolucky	so multiple colors is not necessarily a good idea. I'm also wondering if the #/size you order is a thing.
2014-01-09 13:44:07	jarofghosts	this is referring to number of colors in the design, i believe

2014-01-09 13:53:40	hackygolucky	nvcexploder: for the initial run, the pink/purple mountains
2014-01-09 13:53:52	nvcexploder	ooooooooooohhhhh
2014-01-09 13:53:57	nvcexploder	loves it.
2014-01-09 13:54:23	hackygolucky	but I think any of the mountains will end up on various things.

2014-01-09 15:43:27	chrisdickinson	cc everybody ever
2014-01-09 15:43:41	othiym23	there are many many footguns in the new design
2014-01-09 15:44:01	chrisdickinson	is it very likely that folks will immediately start introducing new language features all at once?
2014-01-09 15:44:23	Wraithan	!m chrisdickinson
2014-01-09 15:44:31	chrisdickinson	(it seems... hard to do that in existing codebases)

2014-01-09 15:45:04	othiym23	chrisdickinson: not everything is implemented yet, and some of the new features are notoriously hard to polyfill (like proper, GCed WeakMaps)

2014-01-09 15:50:28	chrisdickinson	but JS was also thought of differently at that point

2014-01-09 15:51:07	chrisdickinson	& dealt with accordingly.
2014-01-09 15:51:07	othiym23	sure
2014-01-09 15:51:38	Wraithan	the web as a platform was still a foreign idea
2014-01-09 15:51:57	chrisdickinson	I guess what I'm saying is: my assumption is that *most* places that have >1 person touching JS will be fine
2014-01-09 15:52:01	othiym23	if everyone agrees that we should get out in front of this and come up with tooling and idioms for effective ES6 usage, which will be done incrementally and judiciously, no problem

2014-01-09 16:15:24	Wraithan	then in 2015 inflict myself on the conference world again
2014-01-09 16:15:29	hackygolucky	I'm still trying to meet people in JS. Especially those outside of the West coast communities
2014-01-09 16:15:48	Wraithan	yeah, that probably wont happen for me unless they come to west coast confs
2014-01-09 16:15:53	hackygolucky	so many awesome people, so little time.
2014-01-09 16:15:58	Wraithan	right
2014-01-09 16:16:02	hackygolucky	or you go to some non-West coast confs.
2014-01-09 16:16:36	hackygolucky	I am a pusher. Sorry.
2014-01-09 16:16:37	chrisdickinson	I think Wraithan's solution is probably a bit more cost effective :)
2014-01-09 16:16:52	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: it is optimized for different things is all
2014-01-09 16:17:03	hackygolucky	when manifesting in other forms, it can be great. But right now, I'm being obnoxious :P
2014-01-09 16:17:20	Wraithan	if the desired effect is meeting non west coast people, then mine is less cost effective
2014-01-09 16:17:52	JSON_voorhees	 hackygolucky your going to have so much fun at JSConf
2014-01-09 16:17:59	Wraithan	hackygolucky: I may look into some of them, but I know for a fact that I am going to 2 js confs this year alread that are local
2014-01-09 16:18:00	JSON_voorhees	it's seriously amazing
2014-01-09 16:18:05	hackygolucky	JSON_voorhees: I can't wait!!!
2014-01-09 16:18:17	hackygolucky	heard very good things.
2014-01-09 16:18:29	hackygolucky	and my roomie seems like a badass.
2014-01-09 16:18:33	Wraithan	And already have pycon which is east coast, flights over that way take so long
2014-01-09 16:18:55	JSON_voorhees	still gotta find a roomie for this yea
2014-01-09 16:18:56	JSON_voorhees	r
2014-01-09 16:19:10	hackygolucky	Wraithan: but you get time back on the return!
2014-01-09 16:19:34	Wraithan	hackygolucky: lulz
2014-01-09 16:20:10	Wraithan	Eh, I'll make these decisions another time. I know I wont be going to jsconf, it just isn't reasonable for me right now
2014-01-09 16:20:40	othiym23	hackygolucky: you submitted a proposal to JSConf, right?
2014-01-09 16:20:47	hackygolucky	othiym23: yes!
2014-01-09 16:20:55	hackygolucky	though there's little chance in hell it'll be accepted.
2014-01-09 16:20:59	hackygolucky	figured I'd give it a shot.

2014-01-09 16:37:40	hackygolucky	I figured. That's got to be a lot of work.
2014-01-09 16:37:51	othiym23	hackygolucky: last year my talk wasn't accepted *and* I never got notification that it hadn't been accepted

2014-01-09 16:47:30	dlmanning	JSON_voorhees: Yeah! I use these things called mp3's
2014-01-09 16:47:33	dlmanning	They're rad
2014-01-09 16:47:35	JSON_voorhees	I know typically people use s3 for file of that type
2014-01-09 16:47:36	JSON_voorhees	haha
2014-01-09 16:49:06	JSON_voorhees	But i have this hairbrained idea to store track in an arrayBuffer in leveldb so when I sync to the front end you can play directly
2014-01-09 16:49:30	JSON_voorhees	but I'd also like to have the option to convert back to mp3 or whatever and zipup for downloads
2014-01-09 16:49:54	hackygolucky	dlmanning: I... don't know if I'd agree with that. Scott Stepp alone...

2014-01-09 16:51:45	othiym23	JSON_voorhees: MP3s are already containers, not sure what marginal value you're getting out of shoving the audio into a levelDB file
2014-01-09 16:52:15	JSON_voorhees	othiym23: hmm true
2014-01-09 16:52:19	othiym23	unless you just don't feel like dealing with ID3v2 parsing

2014-01-09 17:57:10	othiym23	phated: sure thing, boss
2014-01-09 17:57:48	phated	othiym23: i need to implement a function timer with asyncListener, and i am assuming you have already done this in node-newrelic, am i correct?
2014-01-09 17:58:18	othiym23	phated: not directly with AL
2014-01-09 17:58:33	phated	CLS?
2014-01-09 17:58:37	othiym23	phated: I use CLS to propagate state around, but for timing I wrap functions to be timed up in closures
2014-01-09 17:58:57	phated	othiym23: we are going to break the timing stuff out of gulp
2014-01-09 17:59:31	phated	othiym23: the idea is to use asyncListener to time function calls that have been registered as tasks
2014-01-09 17:59:36	othiym23	mostly because I care about the total time of execution of an action (i.e. the setup plus the wall clock time until the async part is finished)
2014-01-09 18:00:54	othiym23	phated: that should be relatively easy -- what you want to do is use process.createListener, have the init function return a timer object with an ID associated to it, and then have before and after / error stop the timer and send it off to be processed or aggregated or whatever
2014-01-09 18:01:40	othiym23	you'll want to play with it for a bit to figure out intuitively what gets timed and what's going to give you the times that you're expecting
2014-01-09 18:01:43	phated	othiym23: is there a way to use an event emitting singleton to emit the results to?
2014-01-09 18:02:49	othiym23	phated: that's more or less what New Relic does -- there's a "transactionFinished" event that we emit on the tracer, with the transaction as a parameter
2014-01-09 18:03:08	phated	othiym23: so i should read your new relic code? :P
2014-01-09 18:03:33	othiym23	phated: and there's a few listeners on that event that do various forms of trace evaluation and metric aggregation, but a transaction is a higher-level object tied to a whole request cycle, rather than an indvidual function execution
2014-01-09 18:03:47	othiym23	may want to play with it a while to figure out what results in an acceptable level of overhead
2014-01-09 18:04:21	othiym23	phated: it should be reasonably readable if you want to look at it, but there's a bunch of stuff going on at once so it may not be as useful as just trying to do it yourself first and seeing where you get stuck
2014-01-09 18:04:34	phated	othiym23: sweet
2014-01-09 18:04:44	phated	thanks, i will probably be pinging you at some point
2014-01-09 18:05:20	othiym23	I'm around!
2014-01-09 18:05:59	othiym23	phated: Trevor Norris, TJ Fontaine, Jacob Groundwater and I are going to have a little summit next week to try to hash out a more generic tracing mechanism that is probably exactly what you want
2014-01-09 18:06:18	othiym23	but probably won't be available until Node 1.0, because we're just now talking about it and 0.12 is going out soon

2014-01-10 00:06:20	dlmanning	Okay, someone just sent me a PR containing Travis CI builds for a 30-line plugin module
2014-01-10 00:06:48	dlmanning	This, to me, seems a little anal
2014-01-10 00:07:07	Wraithan	eh, running the tests is better than not
2014-01-10 00:07:11	Wraithan	and will run them for PRs
2014-01-10 00:07:13	Wraithan	so why not?
2014-01-10 00:08:19	dlmanning	I don't know... it just seems officious
2014-01-10 00:10:54	dlmanning	I guess I should just consider it nice that people are using my module
2014-01-10 00:13:37	Wraithan	I'm not finding a ton of benefit using backfire with backbone over just using firebase
2014-01-10 00:15:16	Wraithan	I guess part of it is I don't (yet, maybe later?) need any extra functions on my models
2014-01-10 00:15:32	Wraithan	So being able to access the data and sync is good enough
2014-01-10 00:15:45	Wraithan	maybe the benefit is that I am less tied to firebase?
2014-01-10 00:19:46	dlmanning	I used it because it was a drop-in replacement for something the students had already seen
2014-01-10 00:20:11	dlmanning	I didn't have time to cover writing your own sync function
2014-01-10 00:22:09	dlmanning	Ideally you can use backfire and just not think about the backend
2014-01-10 00:22:28	dlmanning	In practice, though, there were a lot of wrinkles
2014-01-10 00:23:54	Wraithan	I guess part of it is that I have collections nested in models that are in collections
2014-01-10 00:24:20	Wraithan	so I have to write extra code to parse those subcollections
2014-01-10 00:24:30	Wraithan	and return real collections, instead of just an array
2014-01-10 00:24:45	phated	JSON_voorhees: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ybgyvum9n77pvh6/nerdjs2.mp4
2014-01-10 00:25:19	dlmanning	Ah
2014-01-10 00:25:23	groundwater	chrisdickinson hackygolucky thanks again
2014-01-10 00:25:42	Wraithan	One of the other benefits of using backbone (that I can see) is that it is a single event system, backbone has a consistent event system firebase would add a second one
2014-01-10 00:26:44	hackygolucky	groundwater, anytime! Great talk. Hope to get to play around with it a little more this weekend.
2014-01-10 00:28:06	dlmanning	Wraithan: wat?
2014-01-10 00:29:11	dlmanning	backfire has its own events system?
2014-01-10 00:30:31	Wraithan	backbone has its own event system
2014-01-10 00:30:37	dlmanning	yeah
2014-01-10 00:30:40	Wraithan	and firebase has one too
2014-01-10 00:30:49	Wraithan	if I were to directly use it instead of using backbone models
2014-01-10 00:31:06	dlmanning	Oh, I see what you mean
2014-01-10 00:31:25	dlmanning	n/m I read firebase as backfire in your original remark

2014-01-10 00:32:18	Wraithan	yes

2014-01-10 00:33:22	Wraithan	and I just realized why something was failing

2014-01-10 12:56:20	hackygolucky	soooo
2014-01-10 12:56:25	hackygolucky	oh wise-irc-one
2014-01-10 12:56:48	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: the backbone stuff itself isn't bad, keeps once something makes a bit more sense I encounter something else that feels cumbersome
2014-01-10 12:56:48	hackygolucky	I need to make a channel similar to what we did for pdxnode-org
2014-01-10 12:57:10	Wraithan	hackygolucky: /msg chanserv set #channel mlock +k password
2014-01-10 12:57:13	hackygolucky	Wraithan: I've already registered the channel. But what would
2014-01-10 12:57:14	hackygolucky	ah
2014-01-10 12:57:44	Wraithan	hackygolucky: adds the 'k' mode and anything after it is the password
2014-01-10 12:59:39	hackygolucky	Wraithan: any other recommended combos of ops stuff for me or the other people in my channel?
2014-01-10 12:59:53	hackygolucky	I guess I could just copy what you did for pdxnodeorg
2014-01-10 13:00:00	hackygolucky	the backlog is tiny :)
2014-01-10 13:00:33	Wraithan	/msg chanserv flags #channel nick +*-O-V
2014-01-10 13:00:50	Wraithan	hackygolucky: that adds all powers except for founder, and removes auto op and auto voice
2014-01-10 13:01:19	hackygolucky	do I need to do that individually for every nick?
2014-01-10 13:01:24	hackygolucky	or can I just pile them all in a row?
2014-01-10 13:01:50	Wraithan	also `/msg chanserv set #channel mlock -t+s` may be good, -t turns off the op requirement to change the topic and +s makes it not show up in channel listings
2014-01-10 13:01:58	Wraithan	hackygolucky: I do it one at a time, there may be a better way
2014-01-10 13:02:04	Wraithan	I have an alias for it though
2014-01-10 13:02:23	Wraithan	so i just say `/makeop nick` and it does that whole command for the current channel
2014-01-10 13:03:26	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: I think I see why people use things like this, but I can see just using a diverse set of modules and building my own system that fits my task a bit better
2014-01-10 13:03:42	Wraithan	but as a construct for bringing in new coders to your front end, I can totally see it being valuable
2014-01-10 13:05:51	dlmanning	Also teams of people
2014-01-10 13:06:46	Wraithan	I can see that to a lesser degree, depending on the team
2014-01-10 13:07:18	Wraithan	It is a lot easier to share knowledge of things that are going to be base to your app with a team as you build it up
2014-01-10 13:07:32	Wraithan	so if your team is (somehow) going to stay constant, then it is fine
2014-01-10 13:09:09	dlmanning	So why would someone send me a PR having added lines of code that are commented out?
2014-01-10 13:09:27	jarofghosts	*scooby doo sound*
2014-01-10 13:09:35	Wraithan	`git add .` or `git commit -am`
2014-01-10 13:12:33	dlmanning	Ah. It's because they copy/pasted them from some other code they were looking at and then forgot to remove them

2014-01-10 14:32:04	othiym23	I really liked backbone until I tried to seriously use it to do something nontrivial, and then I felt ANIMAL FEAR
2014-01-10 14:32:15	othiym23	it's easy to get started with but doesn't scale well
2014-01-10 14:32:26	phated	scale
2014-01-10 14:32:32	phated	massive scale
2014-01-10 14:32:33	othiym23	whereas Angular and Ember are brutal to get started with, but once you're over the hump they get easier to deal with
2014-01-10 14:33:06	Wraithan	jI think I'll continue to
2014-01-10 14:33:10	Wraithan	oops
2014-01-10 14:33:41	Wraithan	othiym23: yeah, this isn't even that serious, just a little pokemon site I'm building
2014-01-10 14:34:28	othiym23	my experience is that little Pokémon sites typically don't stay that way ;)
2014-01-10 14:34:44	othiym23	I think eevee's original ambitions for his site were relatively modest, and now it's a beast
2014-01-10 14:34:48	othiym23	good luck!
2014-01-10 14:34:51	Wraithan	but because I am using firebase with it, which means I am not backed by a relational, means I want to use more deeply nested data structures
2014-01-10 14:34:54	hackygolucky	jden: oh hi
2014-01-10 14:35:05	Wraithan	othiym23: mine is pretty scoped
2014-01-10 14:35:08	Wraithan	so I am not worries
2014-01-10 14:35:14	dlmanning	Wraithan: Well I'm currently having to use Knockout for a contract anyways
2014-01-10 14:35:16	hackygolucky	jden: that's a very good question.
2014-01-10 14:35:36	hackygolucky	a t-shirt would def fit in one of those usps flat rate boxes
2014-01-10 14:35:39	Wraithan	othiym23: If open source has taught me anything over the years it is that scoping matters a lot
2014-01-10 14:35:41	hackygolucky	so I think like 6 bucks?
2014-01-10 14:35:55	hackygolucky	also, hi guise!

2014-01-13 11:08:20	dlmanning	does anyone know if there's a way to have a git branch set up as a point on the file system?
2014-01-13 11:08:31	chrisdickinson	?
2014-01-13 11:08:38	chrisdickinson	a point?
2014-01-13 11:09:10	dlmanning	A place
2014-01-13 11:09:13	dlmanning	a directory
2014-01-13 11:09:41	dlmanning	I'd like to map a directory (or subdirectory of the actual repo) to a branch
2014-01-13 11:10:40	dlmanning	Specificlly, it'd be rad if gh-pages could be mapped to a subdirectory of the project repo
2014-01-13 11:10:58	chrisdickinson	ah
2014-01-13 11:11:13	dlmanning	https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/833223
2014-01-13 11:11:17	dlmanning	this is similar ^
2014-01-13 11:12:02	dlmanning	but it involves adhocness and chicanery
2014-01-13 11:12:28	chrisdickinson	use case being that you want to serve files off of gh-pages but manipulate master?
2014-01-13 11:13:18	dlmanning	Yeah. I'd like to project to be able to create a gh-pages page

2014-01-13 11:14:30	chrisdickinson	is it that you want to see the other branch, or automatically commit to the other branch on changes to master, or both?
2014-01-13 11:14:53	chrisdickinson	(or manually commit to gh-pages but be able to see it?)
2014-01-13 11:15:40	dlmanning	So say /gh-pages is somehow the root of the gh-pages branch

2014-01-13 11:16:36	dlmanning	As I talk about this, I'm realizing that this would involve two seperate workspaces
2014-01-13 11:16:45	chrisdickinson	(basically trying to suss out whether or not it's actually necessary to create a working tree for gh-pages)
2014-01-13 11:17:10	dlmanning	Automatically committing on writes to /gh-pages would be fine
2014-01-13 11:17:40	dlmanning	And that way there don't have to be two working trees
2014-01-13 11:17:46	chrisdickinson	i.e., could you get away with a world where: 1. you can run something like `pretend-fs-is-on gh-pages CMD`
2014-01-13 11:18:04	chrisdickinson	and 2. you've run `carbon-copy master gh-pages CMD-ON-COMMIT`?
2014-01-13 11:18:26	dlmanning	yes, that would work
2014-01-13 11:18:32	chrisdickinson	(i'm kind of working along these lines)
2014-01-13 11:19:04	dlmanning	You mean you've already set this up for yourself?
2014-01-13 11:19:17	chrisdickinson	not quite, i've got part of carbon-copy done
2014-01-13 11:19:33	chrisdickinson	and I have an idea of how to do `pretend-fs-is-on` using FUSE filesystem hilarity
2014-01-13 11:19:43	dlmanning	hilarity indeed
2014-01-13 11:19:59	dlmanning	That sounds pretty awesome
2014-01-13 11:20:24	dlmanning	Is this for beefy?
2014-01-13 11:20:27	chrisdickinson	partially yes
2014-01-13 11:20:48	chrisdickinson	the original desire is to be able to work on master but commit to gh-pages automatically
2014-01-13 11:20:55	chrisdickinson	and have beefy serve up gh-pages
2014-01-13 11:21:44	dlmanning	yes
2014-01-13 11:22:20	chrisdickinson	so like `pretend-fs-is-on gh-pages beefy entry.js` + `carbon-copy master gh-pages markdown-to-html`
2014-01-13 11:22:25	chrisdickinson	(or something!)
2014-01-13 11:24:36	dlmanning	And could you encapsulate that in a 'beefy publish' command?
2014-01-13 11:27:07	chrisdickinson	that's where i get on the fence about things -- beefy publish would probably be primarily for those not using this system, I think
2014-01-13 11:30:25	dlmanning	yeah
2014-01-13 11:30:53	dlmanning	I think most people don't want to type two longish commands
2014-01-13 11:34:09	dlmanning	Can a post-commit hook create assets on a different branch?
2014-01-13 11:37:33	dlmanning	n/m... there doesn't appear to be such a thing as a post-commit hook
2014-01-13 11:38:23	chrisdickinson	there's such thing
2014-01-13 11:38:30	chrisdickinson	https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html
2014-01-13 11:39:11	chrisdickinson	& yes, it should be able to, you just want to be careful and filter the commit action by which branch the commit is going onto
2014-01-13 11:40:16	dlmanning	*nod*
2014-01-13 11:40:48	chrisdickinson	(such thing, so wow)

2014-01-13 15:04:11	bret	Is it possible to add a method to a module that reassigns module.exports to a function?  like this: https://github.com/jxson/front-matter/blob/master/index.js
2014-01-13 15:04:27	dlmanning	JSON_voorheez: I read that as, "I'm into that as a dude who is a scumbag"
2014-01-13 15:04:52	dlmanning	bret : Assigns module.exports to a function?
2014-01-13 15:06:20	bret	dlmanning maybe I am using the wrong words, but see this line: https://github.com/jxson/front-matter/blob/master/index.js#L3
2014-01-13 15:06:25	dlmanning	Assigns a function to module.exports?
2014-01-13 15:06:53	dlmanning	So module.exports is in the global scope, you can assign whatever you want to it any point in any scope
2014-01-13 15:07:20	--	jerrysv__ is now known as jerrysv

2014-01-13 15:07:49	dlmanning	function whatever () { module.exports = function () { /* blergh */ } }
2014-01-13 15:07:58	dlmanning	For example
2014-01-13 15:08:00	bret	when you require the module and assign it to a variable, that variable acts as the function that gets exported there.  I want to add a method without changing the way the module works now
2014-01-13 15:08:33	dlmanning	Okay, so you want to do module.export.mymethod = function () { ... }
2014-01-13 15:08:48	justinabrahms	sounds like dynamically altering exposed methods?
2014-01-13 15:08:54	dlmanning	sorry module.exports.mymethod...
2014-01-13 15:09:03	jerrysv	add the new function in the exported function
2014-01-13 15:09:05	bret	I tried that but it didn't seem to work
2014-01-13 15:09:32	bret	jerrysv, oh maybe that would work…  didn't think of that
2014-01-13 15:10:26	dlmanning	Oh! I bet I know why it didn't work
2014-01-13 15:10:59	dlmanning	You'd need to do module.exports.mymethod = function () {} AFTER the other function has been exported
2014-01-13 15:11:10	jden	hackygolucky: i have not. i believe they exist, tho
2014-01-13 15:11:11	dlmanning	That is to say, after it has been assigned to module.exports
2014-01-13 15:11:15	jden	also, bins++
2014-01-13 15:11:20	dlmanning	Which is basically the same thing jerrysv said
2014-01-13 15:12:20	jerrysv	yeah, what dlmanning said
2014-01-13 15:12:43	 *	bret looks both ways
2014-01-13 15:13:08	dlmanning	Cause at the beginning module.exports = {}
2014-01-13 15:13:21	dlmanning	Then you do module.exports.mymethod = function () {}
2014-01-13 15:13:23	jerrysv	bret: https://gist.github.com/JerrySievert/8409949
2014-01-13 15:13:31	jerrysv	for my way :)
2014-01-13 15:13:46	dlmanning	So now module.exports = { mymethod: function () {} }
2014-01-13 15:13:58	dlmanning	Then you do module.exports = originalFunction
2014-01-13 15:14:00	bret	Ill try it!
2014-01-13 15:14:02	dlmanning	And the reference changes
2014-01-13 15:14:02	bret	:D
2014-01-13 15:14:32	dlmanning	And the object you'd created is banished to oblivion
2014-01-13 15:16:40	bret	 holy hell it worked
2014-01-13 15:16:56	bret	i swear i tried this XD
2014-01-13 15:19:01	bret	thank you dlmanning and jerrysv!
2014-01-13 15:19:17	bret	that was easy

2014-01-13 16:43:46	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: thoughts about beefy supporting a ini or json file or something? is the response typically just make a npm command or import and use it as a library or using something like grunt?
2014-01-13 16:43:51	Wraithan	or a makefile
2014-01-13 16:44:21	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: what's the desired goal?
2014-01-13 16:45:15	chrisdickinson	(if it's to cut down command length / increase discoverability, adding `{scripts: {start: "your-beefy-command args"}}` will enable you to run `npm start` to run the server)
2014-01-13 16:45:43	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: simplify the command so I don't have to remember all the transforms and such that I'm telling to browserify nor having to remember multiple mappings if you are bundling to a couple files, etc
2014-01-13 16:45:54	chrisdickinson	& re: transforms, you can also put them into `browserify: {transforms: [list, of, transform, packages]}` in your package.json to avoid having to specify them (iirc)
2014-01-13 16:45:56	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: yeah, that feels shitty to me
2014-01-13 16:46:19	chrisdickinson	(which is ideal for when you run `browserify` as well so you don't have to put the transforms in two places)
2014-01-13 16:46:26	Wraithan	because it is not explicit what or why those options are in there at all I guess
2014-01-13 16:46:39	Wraithan	I guess I could see if there are longform options
2014-01-13 16:46:42	chrisdickinson	wait, which feels shitty? listing transforms in the package.json?
2014-01-13 16:46:54	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: npm start
2014-01-13 16:47:15	chrisdickinson	okay
2014-01-13 16:47:27	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: "beefy my really long beefy command that uses all the flags and like 4 mappings"
2014-01-13 16:47:30	chrisdickinson	i think the package.json transforms should help out
2014-01-13 16:48:03	chrisdickinson	most of my beefy overhead comes from listing transforms -- are you experiencing something different?
2014-01-13 16:48:18	chrisdickinson	ohh, multiple mappings
2014-01-13 16:48:59	Wraithan	What i want is being able to set the values of the different args in a nice readable way that isn't subject to bash encoding first so I don't have to think about it
2014-01-13 16:49:24	Wraithan	and have them with longname of all the options so you can know that those are mappings and what the other things are
2014-01-13 16:50:06	Wraithan	Maybe I'll just make a wrapper that solves my problem
2014-01-13 16:50:14	Wraithan	and if it is generally useful it can be folded back in

2014-01-13 18:10:21	phated	s5fs: the problem with small modules is that the thing causing it is somewhere else :P
2014-01-13 18:11:02	s5fs	phated: yeah, big design problem imho. i prefer monolithic apps for that reason. current app is over 25k loc, one file.
2014-01-13 18:11:29	othiym23	phated: process.namespacess is analogous to process.domain -- it's an extension hook that allows other things to opportunistically tap into CLS (or domains) without requiring the module if something else hasn't loaded it

2014-01-13 18:11:44	othiym23	because for both CLS and domains just requiring the module makes changes to the running Node runtime
2014-01-13 18:12:02	phated	othiym23: interesting, i think i am having such a hard time because i never used domains >_> so the analogies don't work

2014-01-13 18:13:25	othiym23	phated: anyway, it's a way for me to get at the CLS namespacess without loading the module, and testing whether they've been loaded
2014-01-13 18:14:26	phated	othiym23: i can't get my head around using asyncListener before/after to time function calls, also trying to think about it in terms of CLS but that isn't helping
2014-01-13 18:14:53	phated	a function call in before/after seems to get hooked into asyncListener also
2014-01-13 18:15:28	othiym23	phated: if you try to do async stuff in asyncListener callbacks, you're gonna have a bad time
2014-01-13 18:16:00	othiym23	I should probably but a warning in the documentation explicitly warning people that calls to console.log will fail miserably there, among other things

2014-01-13 19:36:49	othiym23	phated: why do you want to get at the calling function?
2014-01-13 19:37:40	phated	othiym23: we are trying to figure out how long each task in gulp is running
2014-01-13 19:39:26	phated	othiym23: but not only that, if someone executes a function, inside of a task, but is registered as another task, we want to time that also
2014-01-13 19:39:51	phated	othiym23: i am trying to kill off gulp.run because it is horrible and causes too many issues opened
2014-01-13 19:40:30	phated	othiym23: don't you track what functions are taking a long time for node-newrelic?
2014-01-13 19:48:11	othiym23	phated: yeah, but we do that by wrapping the functions up in a closure to do the timing before they're run
2014-01-13 19:48:40	phated	othiym23: ok, so i could only get top level info then
2014-01-13 19:48:45	othiym23	phated: the overhead is minimal because we only target a relatively tiny fraction of the function calls per request (because our instrumentation is opt-in)
2014-01-13 19:49:48	othiym23	phated: depends on what you mean by "top-level info"
2014-01-13 19:50:06	phated	othiym23: let me gist what i am thinking
2014-01-13 19:51:35	phated	othiym23: https://gist.github.com/phated/8412776
2014-01-13 19:52:02	phated	i want gulp.task to "register" task1 and task2 to be timed
2014-01-13 19:52:28	phated	when 'task2' is run, i want to time task2 and task1 functions
2014-01-13 20:00:19	phated	othiym23: maybe i am just insane

2014-01-13 20:05:20	othiym23	phated: because there's potentially more than one async call on a continuation chain
2014-01-13 20:05:38	othiym23	phated: I think what you want is that callback, which unfortunately doesn't exist in the real world
2014-01-13 20:05:51	-->	there8088 (~there8088@6.sub-70-209-66.myvzw.com) has joined #pdxnode
2014-01-13 20:06:15	othiym23	phated: that said, if task1 and task2 are always sync, you can just wrap them up in closures that start timers, call the original functions, and then stop the timers and pass them off to whatever tracks timing
2014-01-13 20:06:27	othiym23	I realize that gulp tasks are frequently not synchronous, though ;)
2014-01-13 20:06:42	othiym23	it's not an insane thing to want, it's just tricky information to get
2014-01-13 20:07:07	othiym23	I'll keep thinking about how you might be able to use asyncListeners to solve this problem
2014-01-13 20:07:46	othiym23	it'd be easier if there were a callback passed to tasks upon invocation for them to call upon completion, or tasks could be promises, or some other way for the tasks to tell gulp when they're done
2014-01-13 20:08:03	phated	othiym23: that is actually what happens
2014-01-13 20:08:04	othiym23	then you wouldn't even need asyncListener at all
2014-01-13 20:08:11	phated	promises, streams, and cb
2014-01-13 20:08:22	phated	but right now, that is triggered by gulp.run
2014-01-13 20:08:37	phated	and i want to remove gulp.run because the logic is complex and people are using it in dumb ways
2014-01-13 20:08:42	othiym23	right

2014-01-13 20:09:53	othiym23	so what you can do is when the task is scheduled using gulp.task, you create a timer, wrap the passed task up in a closure that starts the timer, and create the callback to be passed to it later, which stops the timer (as well as handling errors etc)
2014-01-13 20:10:20	phated	hmm
2014-01-13 20:10:21	othiym23	and then do something analogous with a .when for promises, and on a 'finish' or 'close' event for a stream
2014-01-13 20:10:25	phated	yeah
2014-01-13 20:10:31	phated	which is actually what is happening now
2014-01-13 20:10:35	phated	maybe more complex though
2014-01-13 20:11:08	phated	the problem is the calling a function (say task1) instead of telling gulp to run it
2014-01-13 20:11:16	phated	you lose the ability to do the closure stuff
2014-01-13 20:11:29	phated	on the "internal" tasks
2014-01-13 20:11:42	othiym23	so have gulp.task return a function they can call directly, pass off to setTimeout, what-have-you
2014-01-13 20:12:00	phated	that's actually an interesting concept
2014-01-13 20:12:08	othiym23	you could even get fancy and return a function if they pass a function, a promise if they pass a promise, or a stream if they pass a stream
2014-01-13 20:12:20	othiym23	just make clear they have to invoke the returned thing and not the thing they passed in
2014-01-13 20:13:10	othiym23	the tricky part is making sure the timer gets stopped correctly, but some wanking around with Function.bind or closures ought to solve that

2014-01-15 10:21:43	hackygolucky	phated: yup. I totally get it.
2014-01-15 10:22:07	hackygolucky	Crowdsourcing is complicated and there was only so much transparency.
2014-01-15 10:22:27	hackygolucky	but I don't think isaac devoting his full time to npm is a bad thing
2014-01-15 10:22:39	hackygolucky	I <3 npm. It needs full time support.
2014-01-15 10:23:05	phated	and you know how much i dislike it :P
2014-01-15 10:24:07	hackygolucky	you dislike npm? or the lack of transparency?
2014-01-15 10:24:14	hackygolucky	I thought you just disliked some of the node funk.
2014-01-15 10:24:30	hackygolucky	I mean, substack *ahem*
2014-01-15 10:24:38	phated	my feelings are very complicated about npm
2014-01-15 10:25:09	phated	it is crazy fast to build things, but that comes at a very scary cost
2014-01-15 10:25:13	hackygolucky	I guess more of the business stuff then?
2014-01-15 10:25:16	phated	security, transparency

2014-01-15 10:42:01	othiym23	the reason it took this long for the announcement was that squaring the circle of Nodejitsu, Joyent's and npm, Inc.'s interests took some delicacy
2014-01-15 10:42:26	othiym23	at least Kyle is just sort of skeptical rather than going immediately to accusatory like some of the people on the mailing list
2014-01-15 10:42:44	othiym23	and when I say "took this long" I mean that this transitioned has been planned for a while
2014-01-15 10:42:56	othiym23	(I only found out about it a couple days ago, tho)
2014-01-15 10:47:27	phated	othiym23: shadow node govt of oakland really sucks
2014-01-15 10:50:35	othiym23	phated: get over it dude, it's not a conspiracy
2014-01-15 10:50:53	othiym23	it's just a bunch of people who are peers and live near each other
2014-01-15 10:50:58	othiym23	and in some cases are also friends
2014-01-15 10:51:46	othiym23	TJ is levelheaded and has been doing some of the most important work for Node anyways by keeping the incredibly finicky Node build farm up and running
2014-01-15 10:52:07	phated	othiym23: i think the TJ part is cool and good
2014-01-15 10:52:21	othiym23	Nodejitsu (which is about as far as you can get from Oakland while still being located in the continental US) has done us all a huge favor by keeping the npm registry up and running
2014-01-15 10:52:46	phated	charlie is in the bay until sometime this year :/
2014-01-15 10:53:12	othiym23	and Isaac has been a good faith actor throughout the whole of the last four months during some pretty trying times
2014-01-15 10:53:40	othiym23	I think indexzero took off a while ago, and he was staying at hueniverse's place while he was here, which is in Los Gato
2014-01-15 10:54:09	othiym23	the Oakland JavaScript Mafia is a real thing, but it has more to do with people getting together for brunch than it does the leadership of Node
2014-01-15 10:54:52	othiym23	Max and substack are generally off doing their own things, Mikeal is setting fire to shit, Isaac's first love has always been npm, and there are a bunch more players who just do their thing
2014-01-15 10:54:54	othiym23	there's not a cabal
2014-01-15 10:55:29	othiym23	I only am plugged into this stuff as much as I am because I'm constantly hassling people on #libuv for New Relic and because I'm a nosey parker
2014-01-15 10:55:42	othiym23	and also I'm friends with a lot of these people (because I've been hassling them for New Relic for so long)

2014-01-15 10:56:08	phated	othiym23: seriously though .... "we are growing to fast" -> failures over and over -> "we need money to keep it running" -> receive 300k -> some changes made but still failing -> izs starts a for-profit company -> "it's the only way to make it not suck"
2014-01-15 10:56:14	Wraithan	can node go a week without getting all dramatic and shouting at eachother?
2014-01-15 10:56:22	othiym23	Wraithan: ask phated ;)
2014-01-15 10:56:26	phated	Wraithan: i'm not shouting
2014-01-15 10:56:36	Wraithan	I don't mean this channel in particular
2014-01-15 10:56:54	Wraithan	I mean yet another super controversial thing is happening
2014-01-15 10:57:10	phated	not in the node or js community :P
2014-01-15 10:57:22	phated	i heard it was worse before jsconf was created
2014-01-15 10:57:27	othiym23	phated: the flakiness sucks, but that's a semi-inevitable consequence of trying to go from a single point of failure architecture to a distributed / replicating architecture with a service that's in continuous use
2014-01-15 10:57:36	hackygolucky	phated: charlie is in the bay until next week. I think.
2014-01-15 10:57:45	-->	ahoule (~ahoule@c-67-168-196-93.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #pdxnode
2014-01-15 10:57:53	Wraithan	a good chunk of my twitter feed is people upset about the fundraising/npm inc thing
2014-01-15 10:58:09	s5fs	yeah i just heard
2014-01-15 10:58:15	othiym23	and I stand by everything I wrote in this post: http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/12/19/scalenpm/
2014-01-15 10:58:16	nvcexploder	I became REALLY worried when I saw this tweet this AM : https://twitter.com/eranhammer/status/423508280833351680
2014-01-15 10:58:50	othiym23	haha nvcexploder https://twitter.com/othiym23/status/423510679358689280
2014-01-15 10:58:53	othiym23	great minds etc
2014-01-15 10:59:06	nvcexploder	:D
2014-01-15 11:00:02	othiym23	I think conflating npm the program and npm the service is natural but unhelpful
2014-01-15 11:00:25	othiym23	my assumption is that Isaac's going to concentrate on scaling npm by making it work in a more distributed way
2014-01-15 11:00:46	othiym23	like the work he did to get the tarballs hosted on manta so everything isn't shoved into the registry database
2014-01-15 11:00:59	s5fs	tbh i only threw $7 at scalenpm so i'm not really worried about where that money goes
2014-01-15 11:01:09	othiym23	that doesn't mean that Charlie and Jason aren't still going to have their hands full keeping everything together, potentially for a long time
2014-01-15 11:01:39	othiym23	I gave them $500 even though Charlie makes me want to punch him (and vice versa probably) on the regular
2014-01-15 11:01:40	phated	othiym23: stuffing tarballs anywhere is horrible
2014-01-15 11:01:48	othiym23	I still think it's money well spent
2014-01-15 11:01:59	othiym23	phated: OK! what do you suggest instead?
2014-01-15 11:02:02	phated	othiym23: the NPM disconnect between source code and registry published code is the worst
2014-01-15 11:02:20	othiym23	phated: spoken like a true software developer
2014-01-15 11:02:50	othiym23	ops teams want sane configuration management, which means immutable bindings between versions and their related content
2014-01-15 11:02:51	phated	so i was thinking the other day, i could add a postinstall that changes the installing user's password
2014-01-15 11:03:06	phated	and no one would know
2014-01-15 11:03:21	phated	if you are logged in, i think it just pushes the new password
2014-01-15 11:03:30	phated	haven't tested though
2014-01-15 11:04:05	phated	but it's the same concept as the `rm -rf ~/` concept
2014-01-15 11:04:11	othiym23	yeah, but that's orthogonal to what you were just talking about
2014-01-15 11:04:31	othiym23	just because the code's on GitHub (or w/e) doesn't mean that people can't be sneaky
2014-01-15 11:04:46	phated	if the code is pulled from github tarballs
2014-01-15 11:04:47	othiym23	just look at all the things people have tried to sneak into the Rails codebase
2014-01-15 11:04:52	phated	then they have a much harder time
2014-01-15 11:05:03	othiym23	I think they have exactly as hard a time
2014-01-15 11:05:13	othiym23	you're just moving the trust boundaries around
2014-01-15 11:05:23	phated	currently, everything in npm points you to github source code, but that is not canonical at all
2014-01-15 11:05:34	phated	so how do you have any faith in anything you install?
2014-01-15 11:05:41	othiym23	only if that's what you have in package.json
2014-01-15 11:05:57	othiym23	you should never have faith in anything you install, is what I say wearing my security hat
2014-01-15 11:06:00	othiym23	audit everything
2014-01-15 11:06:02	othiym23	trust noone
2014-01-15 11:06:07	othiym23	keep your lazer handy
2014-01-15 11:06:21	s5fs	fork all the things, point package.json at your own repos
2014-01-15 11:06:25	phated	how do you audit an npm package without installing it?
2014-01-15 11:06:37	phated	s5fs: i am nearly at that point
2014-01-15 11:06:47	othiym23	phated: npm download, unpack the tarball yourself
2014-01-15 11:06:49	JSON_voorhees	http://unionelectrictattoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/102309-trustnoone.jpg
2014-01-15 11:06:54	othiym23	phated: or install in a sandbox
2014-01-15 11:07:15	phated	npm download isn't a command?
2014-01-15 11:07:45	othiym23	no, but you can cache a file without installing it
2014-01-15 11:07:54	othiym23	at the very least, you can curl against the registry
2014-01-15 11:07:57	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: I like the blur on the other tattoo
2014-01-15 11:07:57	s5fs	phated: thats what i'm doing for my hardware project, for a couple of reasons
2014-01-15 11:08:25	othiym23	I don't see why I should trust a tarball hosted on GitHub anymore than a tarball hosted on IrisCouch
2014-01-15 11:08:34	phated	othiym23: it looks like npm info gives you a dist tarball location
2014-01-15 11:08:53	phated	othiym23: because you can't force a github tarball that isn't tied to source code on the site
2014-01-15 11:09:23	phated	othiym23: i guess what i am arguing is the complicated process of auditing npm packages right now
2014-01-15 11:09:33	Wraithan	phated: npm repo <package>
2014-01-15 11:09:51	othiym23	phated: I don't think moving to GH tarballs simplifies that
2014-01-15 11:09:52	phated	Wraithan: that's the problem
2014-01-15 11:09:52	jerrysv	this sounds like a nodeconf talk i heard 2 years ago
2014-01-15 11:09:57	othiym23	you still gotta eyeball the code
2014-01-15 11:10:02	phated	Wraithan: that's not ACTUALLY the code you will be installing
2014-01-15 11:10:14	phated	othiym23: i want to eyeball the code
2014-01-15 11:10:21	jerrysv	https://nodesecurity.io
2014-01-15 11:10:23	phated	othiym23: GH is where i live, i don't want to fetch code
2014-01-15 11:10:26	othiym23	and also not everybody hosts their source on GH
2014-01-15 11:10:34	s5fs	othiym23: what!?
2014-01-15 11:10:40	othiym23	jerrysv: I'm still waiting for Adam to re-start NSP
2014-01-15 11:11:01	othiym23	he paused to do a bunch of retooling and then it hasn't really started up again
2014-01-15 11:11:03	othiym23	s5fs: inorite
2014-01-15 11:11:06	jerrysv	yeah, me too, looks like the last vulernability was july 2013
2014-01-15 11:11:24	s5fs	othiym23: i run my own gitolite server, i guess that's what you mean ;)
2014-01-15 11:11:27	phated	the disconnect between most people using NPM thinking that the source code is the repo the package.json points to and that the code is a tarball is bad
2014-01-15 11:11:41	jerrysv	i guess that RTC really took a number on everyone
2014-01-15 11:11:42	phated	we had a long discussion of this at cascadia
2014-01-15 11:11:53	nvcexploder	phated: I think not wanting to spend time auditing every new version of a module is one reason there are so many modules; it's more fun/easy to make it yourself than to constantly be a build manager
2014-01-15 11:12:07	othiym23	phated: sure, it's bad, but that's not the tool's fault
2014-01-15 11:12:07	phated	nvcexploder: fair point
2014-01-15 11:12:20	Wraithan	phated: send a pr with npm download as a command?
2014-01-15 11:12:20	phated	othiym23: i think it could make things a lot smoother/easier
2014-01-15 11:12:38	phated	Wraithan: have you looked at NPM code? it is horrible....i tried adding something once
2014-01-15 11:12:39	phated	gave up
2014-01-15 11:12:47	s5fs	phated: i love that you're so passionate about npm. i honestly recommend you reach out to isaacs and see if you can provide any assistance.
2014-01-15 11:12:55	s5fs	we know he's got some cash and your rate is totally reasonable
2014-01-15 11:12:56	phated	izs had to start a company cuz no one else can work on it
2014-01-15 11:13:05	phated	s5fs: lololol
2014-01-15 11:13:06	nvcexploder	heh
2014-01-15 11:13:09	othiym23	I think tying npm explicitly to GH would be a suuuuuper bad plan, and I think people would scream if npm started downloading deps file-by-file through source control
2014-01-15 11:13:16	phated	othiym23: i agree
2014-01-15 11:13:38	phated	othiym23: i think the "repo" has to map directly to the source though
2014-01-15 11:13:43	othiym23	the current implementation decouples the packages from source control for that reason, which is a sensible approach IMO
2014-01-15 11:13:51	s5fs	back later
2014-01-15 11:13:52	phated	making it seem like a 1-to-1 confuses people
2014-01-15 11:14:12	othiym23	phated: how do you do that, practically speaking?
2014-01-15 11:14:32	othiym23	that's just a piece of metadata in a package.json file
2014-01-15 11:14:35	phated	even pointing to the tarball on npm would be better
2014-01-15 11:14:46	phated	othiym23: do you use the npm-www?
2014-01-15 11:14:54	othiym23	sure
2014-01-15 11:15:09	phated	everything on it makes it look like the repo source is the source you will be getting
2014-01-15 11:15:12	othiym23	and the repo field is pulled out of the module's manifest (which is to say, package.json)
2014-01-15 11:15:26	othiym23	so what?!
2014-01-15 11:15:27	phated	everyone in the convo at cascadia except chrisdickinson and i thought that was true

2014-01-15 11:15:46	phated	so if you are auditing that source code
2014-01-15 11:15:53	phated	you can still be screwed
2014-01-15 11:16:26	othiym23	I still don't see how this is npm's responsibility
2014-01-15 11:16:34	jerrysv	how could you even couple npm to a git repo?
2014-01-15 11:16:51	othiym23	you want to audit the software that will be running on your machine, you download the software that will be running on your machine, and then you audit it
2014-01-15 11:17:27	phated	not confusing people should be a responsibility
2014-01-15 11:17:32	Wraithan	We are coming up on an hour of rather passionate debate on this subject, maybe we can wrap up and table it for now?
2014-01-15 11:17:40	phated	yeah, i need to work :P
2014-01-15 11:17:49	phated	writing some amazing jquery >_>
2014-01-15 11:17:59	phated	and by that, i mean horrible
2014-01-15 11:18:27	othiym23	phated: I do think s5fs is right, you've clearly got a lot of passion about this, you should connect to isaacs in some way and try to convince him
2014-01-15 11:19:08	phated	othiym23: but i am promises, AMD, internet yelling guy - don't have much pull with him :P
2014-01-15 11:20:50	JSON_voorhees	lol
2014-01-15 11:20:54	othiym23	yeah, but if you want to see this change, he's one of the people you want to convince
2014-01-15 11:21:21	othiym23	Isaac is preternaturally reasonable
2014-01-15 11:21:59	phated	last time i tried to talk to him, he got bored with me in ~5 minutes
2014-01-15 11:22:04	phated	txjs last year
2014-01-15 11:23:00	othiym23	huh

2014-01-15 12:22:02	chrisdickinson	oh, re: npm packages not !== their github equivalents, i have a tool i use called "incept" that lets me sniff around
2014-01-15 12:22:05	chrisdickinson	i should probably publish it :\
2014-01-15 12:22:11	chrisdickinson	it's kind of funny, because in the bad old days it was hard to get back to the original repo for a given package from the npm package
2014-01-15 12:22:17	chrisdickinson	s/npm package/npm (cli search results| website)/g
2014-01-15 12:22:20	chrisdickinson	once the website got better it got easier
2014-01-15 12:22:23	chrisdickinson	and then once the website started handling outgoing links to github a bit better, it got even easier
2014-01-15 12:22:32	chrisdickinson	and now the problem is that folks are led to believe (by that ease of finding the source repo) that the two are one and the same

2014-01-15 12:50:53	rick_at_nwea	I got a call from the guy I know (I've know him for > 10 years) this morning.
2014-01-15 12:51:28	Wraithan	Well putting out there that companies are looking for work isn't a problem here, as long as you don't get spammy about it :)
2014-01-15 12:52:06	rick_at_nwea	I won't be.  I like helping the guy out because he has done a good job for me on occasion.
2014-01-15 12:52:35	hackygolucky	rick_at_nwea: Oh! that's why it sounds familiar. I think I got an email from that recruiter.
2014-01-15 12:52:45	Wraithan	I've done the inverse, where I asked if anyone wanted to hire me, so I can't blame companies if they want to adverise here too :)

2014-01-15 12:57:24	JSON_voorhees	Can't we just direct that stuff to silicon florist or something?
2014-01-15 12:58:35	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: an occasional 'hey we are hiring' doesn't detract from things at all, I think.
2014-01-15 12:58:45	JSON_voorhees	two days in a row now
2014-01-15 12:59:20	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: two different companies
2014-01-15 12:59:21	JSON_voorhees	There are just more approriate mediums is all
2014-01-15 12:59:57	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: we talk about all sorts of off topic stuff in here, JS jobs are pretty on topic
2014-01-15 13:01:41	JSON_voorhees	you don't see that stuff in #node.js
2014-01-15 13:02:16	chrisdickinson	#node.js is pretty noisy as is
2014-01-15 13:02:41	Wraithan	#node.js has more traffic and more people and are less regionally focused, they need to be more strict about things in order to maintain any semblance of signal:noise
2014-01-15 13:03:13	Wraithan	a job in portland doing js (specifically node in this case) sounds pretty on topic to me
2014-01-15 13:03:19	JSON_voorhees	yep, would just rather not have much of that stuff in here, we all get blasted with ads and emails all day everyday
2014-01-15 13:03:54	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: a random recruiter vs a person who is a part of your community are different, I think
2014-01-15 13:04:08	JSON_voorhees	sure thing
2014-01-15 13:04:36	Wraithan	I'm less keen on what jive dide, but rick_at_nwea as been in here and discussed things with us in the past
2014-01-15 13:04:49	Wraithan	dide? did.

2014-01-15 16:33:13	s5fs	i watched TNG on netflix end-to-end and then original series on netflix end-to-end and then tried DS9 which burned me out
2014-01-15 16:33:16	s5fs	never quite recovered
2014-01-15 16:33:48	nvcexploder	heh. I binged on TNG while sick during the Holidays
2014-01-15 16:34:05	nvcexploder	Jean Luc's calming voice helped me weather storms of nausea

2014-01-15 16:35:34	othiym23	speaking of the enterprise, time to explain to the NR enterprise what hapi is an why we're supporting it
2014-01-15 16:37:16	JSON_voorhees	My old roommate made me watch an episode of tng where they go to this sex planet

2014-01-15 16:39:55	s5fs	also i'm pretty sure that's not the first daggering joke i've heard you tell, but you are the only person i've known to make a daggering joke. i laugh every time!
2014-01-15 16:40:00	Wraithan	nvcexploder: binge-ed not bing-ed, I was so confused when I read that the first time

2014-01-15 16:43:44	JSON_voorhees	This guy I work with just told me about a prank where you pee into a cookie sheet and freeze it, then you take the pee-sheet and slide under your friends door, then when they wake up the next morning after it has melted, they have a mysterious puddle in their room.
2014-01-15 16:44:09	s5fs	JSON_voorhees: same thing works with ice cubes and pillows

2014-01-15 16:45:42	othiym23	I just remembered
2014-01-15 16:46:10	s5fs	othiym23: we should send JSON to the fulsom street nodebots day
2014-01-15 16:46:22	JSON_voorhees	s5fs: perfect

2014-01-16 19:31:01	phated	what part is unclear?
2014-01-16 19:31:10	phated	to push back to github, you need an API key
2014-01-16 19:31:24	phated	travis allows you to encrypt that API key so people can't access your repo
2014-01-16 19:31:39	hackygolucky	so did I just post an unencrypted key?
2014-01-16 19:31:40	phated	travis decrypts it on commits to your repo, but not PRs
2014-01-16 19:31:56	phated	hackygolucky: no - https://github.com/knode/node-meatspace/blob/master/.travis.yml#L8
2014-01-16 19:32:15	phated	also, you need to change the github ref at https://github.com/knode/node-meatspace/blob/master/.travis.yml#L7

2014-01-16 19:34:33	hackygolucky	right?

2014-01-16 20:38:16	mikeal	he's been IM'ing me
2014-01-16 20:38:37	hackygolucky	Oh, well that's another way. Pfft
2014-01-16 20:39:48	phated	haha
2014-01-16 20:40:04	phated	i am bad at IRC, dunno how to find someone if they aren't in my channels
2014-01-16 20:40:16	phated	and then i just double click their name
2014-01-16 20:41:20	hackygolucky	You get your questions answered then?
2014-01-16 20:41:32	hackygolucky	Wondering how we work around the api key.
2014-01-16 20:41:33	phated	yeah
2014-01-16 20:41:40	phated	i can generate one
2014-01-16 20:41:52	phated	from my personal account :/
2014-01-16 20:42:57	mikeal	can you use deploy keys for this?
2014-01-16 20:43:15	phated	maybe
2014-01-16 20:43:19	phated	probably
2014-01-16 20:43:20	phated	not sure
2014-01-16 20:43:37	mikeal	i've only used them for reads
2014-01-16 20:44:36	phated	it looks like they work for writes
2014-01-16 20:47:19	hackygolucky	Looking now.
2014-01-16 20:48:35	hackygolucky	(tracy's husband here) You can probably use a deploy key for that. You should take special care though, that you don't enter a circular loop where your CI system builds based on a push and you push as part of your CI run. Assuming this was hooked into travis beforehand, it should be fine.
2014-01-16 20:49:10	hackygolucky	I've used deploy keys for pushing things in the past. Not 100% sure the API is exactly the same, but it should be fine.
2014-01-16 20:49:31	mikeal	it was working in mikeal/node-meatspace before
2014-01-16 20:49:51	mikeal	it only builds on pushes to master, and then it deploys to gh-pages
2014-01-16 20:50:16	hackygolucky	cool. deploy keys are per repo, iirc, so you'll need to build one for its new, current location.
2014-01-16 20:50:30	mikeal	yeah
2014-01-16 20:50:50	mikeal	should we continue trying to get ahold of greg or just move the service hook to someone else's travis account?
2014-01-16 20:51:01	mikeal	i know nothing about travis, so that probably shouldn't be me :)

2014-01-16 21:01:36	phated	if we did a travis encrypt on the ssh key

2014-01-17 11:51:30	dlmanning	Is the "sprint" part of sprintly from agile sprints?

2014-01-17 11:51:44	justinabrahms	dlmanning: it was originally, but we don't actually have a notion of sprints in the project.

2014-01-17 11:52:16	dlmanning	justinabrahms: Wish my current project were using sprintly

2014-01-17 11:53:28	dlmanning	Unfortunately, I think our timeframe is a little short to switch at this point

2014-01-17 13:09:45	jarofghosts	but then everyone surpassed me because i couldnt play it 24/7
2014-01-17 13:09:48	hackygolucky	I thought at one point we didn't, but not sure.
2014-01-17 13:10:03	hackygolucky	I definitely have Steam on my work comp because of it :P

2014-01-17 13:12:26	Wraithan	I was second or third best on the team depending on matchup
2014-01-17 13:12:47	jarofghosts	im not good at much, but i am confident in my tf2ing

2014-01-17 13:14:38	Wraithan	each week, when I was really trying to get better was ~5 hours of watching streams (at least) and ~10-15 hours of playing

2014-01-17 14:41:12	Wraithan	__love__: setup.py wouldn't actually exist yet, so you couldn't do `python setup.py init` the idea is initing the setup.py file, not calling it and using it's init functionality
2014-01-17 14:41:36	__love__	Wraithan: no no. you write a basic setup.py. or maybe even just touch it. and then MAGIC

2014-01-17 14:43:27	Wraithan	__love__: ya, that is why I am opening issues on pip instead of writing code...
2014-01-17 14:43:29	JSON_voorhees	chrisdickinson: does that answer your question?
2014-01-17 14:43:46	__love__	open an issue of "not enough magic in setup.y"
2014-01-17 14:44:02	JSON_voorhees	not *any* magic in setup.py
2014-01-17 14:45:01	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: so, I'd say someone could build a third party tool to do that, much like pip and co where back in the day, but I think it then wouldn't get enough eyes to see if it is actually good/works
2014-01-17 14:45:04	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorhees: it does but I still wanna use #blessed, this is such a struggle
2014-01-17 14:45:12	JSON_voorhees	use them both
2014-01-17 14:45:18	chrisdickinson	maybe i'll add #arduous
2014-01-17 14:45:58	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: I wonder if you could release a package that would glue setuptools/distutils to a json package descriptor
2014-01-17 14:45:59	Wraithan	oh oh oh, I know, we can just grab all packages off of pypi, and use some sort of pattern matching to see what projects look most like yours, and use the setup.py from those projects as a template
2014-01-17 14:47:15	__love__	maybe a cookiecutter template?
2014-01-17 14:47:17	__love__	i think there's one already
2014-01-17 14:47:22	Wraithan	"Oh, I see you use project layout like django-registration, but code style like kennethreitz, we averaged their setup.py files and came up with this template"
2014-01-17 14:47:49	Wraithan	could be called clip.py as in the dude from ms word

2014-01-17 14:48:31	Wraithan	__love__: ya, I don't want all their other crap
2014-01-17 14:48:33	Wraithan	just setup.py
2014-01-17 14:48:46	__love__	yeah, but you could start there and pare down
2014-01-17 14:49:15	__love__	really just need something to ask questions and write out the setup.py based on your answers
2014-01-17 14:49:30	Wraithan	__love__: right
2014-01-17 14:49:35	Wraithan	I know what it needs to do

2014-01-17 14:49:58	Wraithan	with my rants about all the problems people would come up with surrounding it
2014-01-17 14:50:01	__love__	i bet chrisdickinson could whip up a node app that does it ;)
2014-01-17 14:50:12	chrisdickinson	hahah
2014-01-17 14:50:16	chrisdickinson	i bet that would make SO MUCH headway
2014-01-17 14:50:34	__love__	"install node to write python packages"
2014-01-17 14:50:41	__love__	no one will have issues with that
2014-01-17 14:51:10	Wraithan	is that more or less sane than find an author you like and copy their setup.py?
2014-01-17 14:51:35	__love__	i vote for 'more sane'
2014-01-17 14:52:36	chrisdickinson	to package python sanely, i write python, cross compile it to javascript, and then publish it on npm

2014-01-17 16:36:42	Wraithan	I've been doing vendor/jquery.js, then in that `module.exports = jQuery`
2014-01-17 16:36:46	Wraithan	etc etc
2014-01-17 16:36:51	JSON_voorhees	Wraithan: you mean by loading from a cdn?
2014-01-17 16:36:59	JSON_voorhees	in a script tag?
2014-01-17 16:37:22	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: well I load it in a script tag because other libs I'm using require it and aren't browserify friendly
2014-01-17 16:37:41	Wraithan	but since I am going to remove backfire I probably wont actually need to do that anymore and can just bundle it all
2014-01-17 16:37:59	JSON_voorhees	I thought their was commonjs support for jquery
2014-01-17 16:38:04	Wraithan	JSON_voorhees: there is
2014-01-17 16:38:29	JSON_voorhees	oh just reread your message I see now
2014-01-17 16:38:34	Wraithan	but backfire doesn't have it, and backfire needs jquery, so I have to grab jquery in a script tag for it
2014-01-17 16:38:38	JSON_voorhees	what other libs are you using that depend on it?
2014-01-17 16:39:53	Wraithan	right now, that is the only one that isn't commonjs ready
2014-01-17 16:39:59	JSON_voorhees	ahh okay
2014-01-17 16:40:30	Wraithan	but for backbone, because of how it works, I have to have a vendor/ for it

2014-01-17 16:41:49	Wraithan	also have to do that with underscore iirc

2014-01-18 13:05:29	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: re: bootstrap, what about knode.github.io/style?
2014-01-18 13:05:36	hackygolucky	oh shit
2014-01-18 13:05:36	hackygolucky	yes
2014-01-18 13:05:38	hackygolucky	lo siento
2014-01-18 13:05:41	hackygolucky	*oops*
2014-01-18 13:06:04	chrisdickinson	the templates will either live in there or in the main knode.github.io repo, yes?
2014-01-18 13:06:07	hackygolucky	updated.
2014-01-18 13:06:17	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: do you have a preference
2014-01-18 13:06:25	hackygolucky	I was planning on them being in their respective repos
2014-01-18 13:06:27	chrisdickinson	(the thought being knode.github.io is the repo with the "build me a site" command)
2014-01-18 13:06:43	chrisdickinson	and that the others are just metadata + a way to expose that meta-dater
2014-01-18 13:06:50	hackygolucky	but I guess I should have a templates directory with the individual html files?

2014-01-18 13:27:20	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: How do I hook into npm build?
2014-01-18 13:27:45	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: {"scripts": {"build": "exciting bash command"}} I do believe
2014-01-18 13:28:02	chrisdickinson	lemme double check
2014-01-18 13:28:02	dlmanning	Well that would do it... :)
2014-01-18 13:28:39	dlmanning	I thought maybe there was some super leet way using the dependencies prop or something
2014-01-18 13:29:28	chrisdickinson	it might not exist (in which case we'd call `npm run build`, which i'm okay with)
2014-01-18 13:29:29	dlmanning	Cause 'npm build' is a real thing in its own
2014-01-18 13:29:29	chrisdickinson	yeahhh
2014-01-18 13:29:36	chrisdickinson	build might hook into: https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html
2014-01-18 13:29:48	chrisdickinson	actuallllly
2014-01-18 13:29:53	chrisdickinson	npm update
2014-01-18 13:29:56	chrisdickinson	that would be best, yes?
2014-01-18 13:30:02	chrisdickinson	because then npm update also builds the thing
2014-01-18 13:30:17	dlmanning	Sure
2014-01-18 13:30:22	dlmanning	That'd do
2014-01-18 13:30:58	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: ooh, one thing!
2014-01-18 13:31:04	chrisdickinson	you might want to pull into a different branch than master
2014-01-18 13:31:15	chrisdickinson	well
2014-01-18 13:31:31	chrisdickinson	(it looks like gh-pages is serving up master on knode.github.io)
2014-01-18 13:31:35	chrisdickinson	eeh
2014-01-18 13:31:37	chrisdickinson	disregard

2014-01-18 13:57:23	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Maybe I'm missing something dumb, but (pre|post||)update hooks aren't firing on 'npm update'
2014-01-18 13:57:35	chrisdickinson	interesting
2014-01-18 13:57:43	chrisdickinson	perhaps they only fire if something actually requires an update
2014-01-18 13:57:52	dlmanning	but preupdate should fire anyway
2014-01-18 13:58:47	chrisdickinson	try adding a package to deps and then running npm update
2014-01-18 13:59:10	dlmanning	did
2014-01-18 13:59:22	dlmanning	No joy
2014-01-18 14:00:18	chrisdickinson	huh.
2014-01-18 14:00:23	dlmanning	yeah
2014-01-18 14:00:54	chrisdickinson	yeah, i'm otherwise fine with a custom script (such that `npm run scriptname` works)
2014-01-18 14:01:14	dlmanning	Going to try installing old version / changing dep requirement / running npm update
2014-01-18 14:02:38	dlmanning	Still no...

2014-01-18 14:22:01	hackygolucky	each repo should be a separate page or section
2014-01-18 14:22:08	dlmanning	Okay
2014-01-18 14:22:19	hackygolucky	technically, each repo is just a different section of the site
2014-01-18 14:22:29	hackygolucky	as for pages or a single page with sections
2014-01-18 14:22:32	 *	hackygolucky shrugs
2014-01-18 14:22:44	chrisdickinson	one repo may map to several views
2014-01-18 14:22:47	hackygolucky	or a mixture of both
2014-01-18 14:24:04	chrisdickinson	or rather, may feed data to multiple views
2014-01-18 14:24:25	dlmanning	right, and those views are templates?
2014-01-18 14:24:37	chrisdickinson	knode.github.io pulls info from speakers, meetups, and pulls templates from style
2014-01-18 14:25:00	chrisdickinson	and it renders things and blorps 'em out into html-on-disk
2014-01-18 14:25:58	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I'm having trouble understanding the parameters of what I'm writing here
2014-01-18 14:26:02	chrisdickinson	info for cfp will come from (google spreadsheets|firebase|some api someplace)
2014-01-18 14:26:29	dlmanning	Cause at a most basic level it's just require('knode-meetups')().on('data', aFunction);
2014-01-18 14:28:17	dlmanning	But what aFunction actually does next seems to depend on a plan that you already have
2014-01-18 14:28:37	chrisdickinson	yeah :|
2014-01-18 14:28:40	chrisdickinson	to further explain:
2014-01-18 14:28:52	chrisdickinson	style repo exports templates -- list and detail
2014-01-18 14:29:01	chrisdickinson	that's what hackygolucky is doing if i'm not mistaken
2014-01-18 14:29:11	hackygolucky	yah
2014-01-18 14:29:12	chrisdickinson	knode.github.io contains a build script that requires style
2014-01-18 14:29:17	chrisdickinson	and requires meetups, and speakers
2014-01-18 14:29:44	chrisdickinson	(meetups is done, and the meanest of daves is working on a similar package for speakers)
2014-01-18 14:30:29	dlmanning	Okay
2014-01-18 14:31:10	chrisdickinson	when it is executed, it renders the appropriate information to templates -- render "detail" to /index.html, render meetups info + list template to /meetups/index.html, render speakers info + list template to /speakers/index.html
2014-01-18 14:31:10	dlmanning	I feel like those parts need to exist first
2014-01-18 14:32:08	dlmanning	Are you guys all in a place?
2014-01-18 14:32:14	chrisdickinson	those will need to exist ultimately.
2014-01-18 14:32:23	chrisdickinson	we're at bare bones -- i'm only here for ~1ish more hour
2014-01-18 14:33:16	dlmanning	Okay. Sorry for the confusion!
2014-01-18 14:33:57	chrisdickinson	no worries!
2014-01-18 14:36:43	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: knode.github.io could eventually be a good place for `gulp`, I imagine
2014-01-18 14:38:56	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Okay, I think I see the vision now
2014-01-18 14:40:00	chrisdickinson	cool, sorry for communicating so haphazardly / poorly D:
2014-01-18 14:40:19	dlmanning	No, no. You guys have been talking about this for awhile and I've not been paying attention
