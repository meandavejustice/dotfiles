2014-01-16 11:53:57	phuongie	I get to go to the Superbowl guys....in the freezing cold. Woot!
2014-01-16 11:54:31	grantgarrett	phuongie: really?
2014-01-16 11:54:38	grantgarrett	howd you get those tickets?
2014-01-16 11:54:40	florapdx	phuongie: Lucky! I'm jealous
2014-01-16 11:54:59	phuongie	Yeah. My husband manages the nfl network account for his company and scored us two tickets
2014-01-16 11:55:29	phuongie	I hope the 49ers make it (even though oddly enough my husband is a Cleveland Browns fan)
2014-01-16 11:55:30	meandavejustice	I bet seattle people would HATE the seahawks one
2014-01-16 11:56:36	meandavejustice	and I like that the baltimore raven is wearing a kufi
2014-01-16 11:56:48	phuongie	seattle people hate the seahawks meandavejustice ?
2014-01-16 11:57:04	phuongie	oh, sorry, "one" not WON
2014-01-16 11:58:13	meandavejustice	I was referring to the logo
2014-01-16 12:07:08	justinabrahms	http://s.mlkshk.com/r/WP0H.gif
2014-01-16 12:07:29	justinabrahms	I have no clue what that's for, but I really want to know what the hell it is.
2014-01-16 12:07:51	grantgarrett	is that Cheese Man and Peppermill Guy?
2014-01-16 12:07:57	chrisforrette	haha
2014-01-16 12:08:08	grantgarrett	seasoning and flavoring her meal?
2014-01-16 12:08:09	chrisforrette	you've apparently entered grantgarrett's wheelhouse
2014-01-16 12:08:14	justinabrahms	actually, that makes TOTAL sense.
2014-01-16 12:08:30	chrisforrette	but it looks like she has a thing of yogurt
2014-01-16 12:08:32	justinabrahms	way more than "chess piece face and wedge face"
2014-01-16 12:08:38	grantgarrett	can't tell if peppermill or chess piece...
2014-01-16 12:08:40	grantgarrett	^
2014-01-16 12:08:47	chrisforrette	i thought it was a pepper mill too
2014-01-16 12:09:21	grantgarrett	maybe its a chess piece and a wedge from trivial pursuit?
2014-01-16 12:09:43	grantgarrett	board game piece heros?
2014-01-16 12:10:04	justinabrahms	i just love how freaked out she is.
2014-01-16 12:10:57	grantgarrett	wouldnt you be too? if you were in the middle of some snowy woods, trying to enjoy a fresh foam cup of ramen and 2 dudes in tights and game piece shaped helmets popped out of nowhere?
2014-01-16 12:11:16	chrisforrette	i would be freaked out if dudes like that showed up and started trying to put pepper and cheese in yogurt via that weird karate dance

2014-01-16 12:12:29	chrisforrette	im actually giving it some thought and i think it would be the most traumatizing thing that would happen in my life to date

2014-01-16 12:14:28	grantgarrett	that's uhhh, some mill ya got there
2014-01-16 12:14:49	grantgarrett	I wonder if 1 nostril is for salt, the other for pepper

2014-01-16 12:18:30	chrisforrette	i ended up on http://shutupandtakemymoney.com/
2014-01-16 12:18:52	grantgarrett	that mesh vest is quite different from ones previous
2014-01-16 12:19:08	chrisforrette	grantgarrett: it's more healthy
2014-01-16 12:19:45	grantgarrett	you can hold fish in the pockets
2014-01-16 12:20:24	grantgarrett	amazon is trying to sell fishing lures on that same page
2014-01-16 12:20:44	chrisforrette	i suppose fishing could be classified as a "tactical scenario"
2014-01-16 12:20:52	grantgarrett	along with a Punisher Tactical Patch
2014-01-16 12:21:01	justinabrahms	as opposed to a "strategic scenario"?
2014-01-16 12:21:48	grantgarrett	Strategic Suspenders
2014-01-16 12:22:09	grantgarrett	underneath your Tactical Vest
2014-01-16 12:26:11	meandavejustice	that vest would go great with my utili-kilt

2014-01-16 13:43:49	meandavejustice	ahh
2014-01-16 13:44:33	meandavejustice	I only mention that since editing another project's readme creates a patch and makes a pr, but editing your own commit's straight to master which is weird
2014-01-16 13:44:51	meandavejustice	that is _when editing in their web editor_

2014-01-16 13:48:11	meandavejustice	hmm
2014-01-16 13:48:14	justinabrahms	meandavejustice: on your own branch, you can make a branch from the UI then do the commit / pr flow
2014-01-16 13:48:33	meandavejustice	what?
2014-01-16 13:49:24	justinabrahms	you can do prs for your own repo from the github UI is all I'm saying.
2014-01-16 13:49:37	nicholasserra	Nice.
2014-01-16 13:49:46	meandavejustice	I know it's possible just not the default

2014-01-16 14:03:12	justinabrahms	I ended up just writing emacs macros b/c the require imports thing was a little broken (it deleted some comments)
2014-01-16 14:03:21	meandavejustice	oh
2014-01-16 14:03:47	meandavejustice	I'll write a macro
2014-01-16 14:03:54	meandavejustice	You can save those for reuse right?

2014-01-16 14:55:48	joestump	So $6k in MRR increase in a month would be an 18% jump in MRR, but you'd churn out some too.

2014-01-16 14:58:02	chrisforrette	just want to share this OH from meandavejustice: "If I don't go to sleep naked, I'll usually end up naked because I get so hot at night"

2014-01-16 15:04:28	grantgarrett	joestump: how will revenue churn be different from our (old) seat churn?
2014-01-16 15:04:55	phuongie	I'm curious how you guys paired yourselves up vs how I paired you guys up on my end chrisforrette
2014-01-16 15:05:11	joestump	grantgarrett: We don't charge by price anymore.
2014-01-16 15:05:16	joestump	grantgarrett: Derp. By seat.
2014-01-16 15:05:34	chrisforrette	phuongie: that was the question that spurred the discussionâ€”did you pair us up already?
2014-01-16 15:05:57	phuongie	Sort of but it doesn't matter who goes with who with the exception of me and florapdx
2014-01-16 15:06:12	grantgarrett	I'm guessing we'll break new churn into churn by plan and an overall churn?
2014-01-16 15:06:20	chrisforrette	phuongie: yea, i don't think anyone's too concerned

2014-01-16 15:08:45	phuongie	joestump: nicholasserra is working on account and rev daily report changes for me right now...fyi in case wanted to implement the rev churn numbers in
2014-01-16 15:09:50	grantgarrett	yeah, those daily reports are confusing, cause its still showing new paying customers in a per seat plan (which I guess is still technically correct)
2014-01-16 15:11:09	phuongie	justinabrahms: I was about to go on staging to start testing the build but Travis is showing a build error on your merge. Something to check out before I test?
2014-01-16 15:11:46	justinabrahms	grantgarrett: that's right. revenue churn is "how much less money are we making?" eg: large -> medium plan transitions. vs total number of plans (which is what we do now because plan == seat)
2014-01-16 15:12:36	grantgarrett	cant wait till we get a negative churn month
2014-01-16 15:12:49	grantgarrett	wait, is that possible?
2014-01-16 15:13:05	justinabrahms	phuongie: looking now.
2014-01-16 15:13:19	justinabrahms	grantgarrett: yes. you lose no customers and have plan upgrades.
2014-01-16 15:13:35	nicholasserra	Travis is confusing in that the build will be failed if the last push failed, but not necessarily master
2014-01-16 15:14:40	phuongie	negative churn = http://image.blingee.com/images17/content/output/000/000/000/6b6/618062699_677738.gif

2014-01-16 15:39:34	justinabrahms	though I'd guess it's how much it's worth?

2014-01-16 15:43:05	meandavejustice	not in your pr just on our site, is that related to adwords?
2014-01-16 15:43:13	meandavejustice	cus it's listed as separate
2014-01-16 15:43:15	justinabrahms	yes.
2014-01-16 15:43:19	justinabrahms	doubleclick == google ads
2014-01-16 15:43:50	meandavejustice	So that tracks clicks from display ads into our app?
2014-01-16 15:44:36	justinabrahms	we have google analytics setup, which will track our traffic. Doubleclick tracker may be the same thing.
2014-01-16 15:44:48	justinabrahms	I know when you generate the snippet you can enable some ad features which may change it's name.

2014-01-16 16:10:05	meandavejustice	that should be replaced with the select2 page object

2014-01-16 16:13:44	meandavejustice	I belive that is in order to get the list to open?
2014-01-16 16:15:14	nicholasserra	Hm. Yah this test is very odd. I'm going to rewrite it and hope that solves my issues.

2014-01-16 16:47:43	nicholasserra	After I cleaned it up it just needed some delay. I accomplished the same thing by just adding some time.sleep to it.

2014-01-16 17:42:50	florapdx	I'm having some issues when setting filters, visiting Mine view, and then navigating to Reports FYI, phuongie meandavejustice
2014-01-16 17:43:15	phuongie	pages not loading or ? florapdx
2014-01-16 17:43:43	nicholasserra	I thought they were supposed to clear.
2014-01-16 17:43:47	nicholasserra	We need flow charts.
2014-01-16 17:44:11	florapdx	Items not loading :(
2014-01-16 17:44:51	meandavejustice	That is all fixed and heavily tested in my latest pr
2014-01-16 17:45:01	meandavejustice	unfortunatly I did not get it into today's release
2014-01-16 17:45:22	florapdx	Radness
2014-01-16 17:45:23	phuongie	You're setting the filters in Mine and then navigating to Reports florapdx ?
2014-01-16 17:46:37	florapdx	Setting filters in dashboard view, then visiting mine, then reports. Dave says that the issue is fixed in a pr for next deploy though
2014-01-16 17:48:58	phuongie	Hmm, items loaded okay for me. clear cache florapdx ? Can anyone else repro?
2014-01-16 17:49:25	nicholasserra	meandavejustice confirmed the issue. Fixed in a PR
2014-01-16 17:53:45	phuongie	My concern is that the next deploy is not going to happen for another week a half probably

2014-01-16 17:59:05	phuongie	I just tried under FF and Safari with different filters and was ok. Let me try yours florapdx. Are you able to reproduce many times?
2014-01-16 17:59:28	florapdx	Yeah, unfortunately.
2014-01-16 18:01:28	phuongie	What's wierd about your screenshot flora is that it is missing the Status filter (Someday, Backlog etc)
2014-01-16 18:01:37	phuongie	florapdx: ^

2014-01-16 18:02:56	florapdx	Oh, that is weird. I wonder how I managed to do that :/
2014-01-16 18:04:04	phuongie	You have magic powers. I'm sure there was some sequence that caused it. We just have to figure it out
2014-01-16 18:04:12	florapdx	I just went through this again. Try unsetting the 'tagged with' filter by pressing the x. Do you get a refresh? I just get the 'reset filters' bar and 'tagged with' label is still at top
2014-01-16 18:05:08	florapdx	Also, when I go to reports via Mine view, the filter for assigned_to: (me) is unset. That didn't happen for you logged in as me though. That's also really weird!
2014-01-16 18:05:17	phuongie	oh geez. it let me delete one tag but not the other

2014-01-16 18:09:32	phuongie	Hmmm, under my account I was able to remove both tags ok
2014-01-16 18:10:18	phuongie	Can you try another browser florapdx ?
2014-01-16 18:10:28	florapdx	yeah, I'll try safari
2014-01-16 18:10:49	florapdx	I wish I had your screen video capture tool phuongie

2014-01-16 18:11:55	phuongie	I'm sure you're not crazy, btw. I know it's happening...I just want to figure out what the sequence is and if it is likely for a user to do the same thing and break it like you
2014-01-16 18:14:44	florapdx	Play-by-play: 1. In dashboard view, select Me-pricing priority from saved filters. 2. From menu, select Mine view (be prepared to wait while accepted items load). 3. Choose reports from menu. The filter for assigned_to --> me will be gone. Try to unset the remaining tagged with filters.
2014-01-16 18:15:26	phuongie	before I forget, our hotel rooms are NON-SMOKING meandavejustice !
2014-01-16 18:15:38	florapdx	I see this at the end of that sequence: https://cloudup.com/cmW2wqvFdAE
2014-01-16 18:17:57	florapdx	Also, duh. I'll just pull dave's branch down and verify that it fixes this for me.
2014-01-16 18:18:19	phuongie	That's cool and since I"m having a hard time reproducing, I'm not going to say that we need to revert.

2014-01-17 11:32:49	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: what command did you run to deploy last night?
2014-01-17 11:33:42	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: The commands in the README
2014-01-17 11:33:44	nicholasserra	Same ones I've always used.
2014-01-17 11:33:54	justinabrahms	mind looking through your history and pasting it for me?
2014-01-17 11:34:30	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: https://gist.github.com/nicholasserra/2118bf4c8070c234390c
2014-01-17 11:34:44	meandavejustice	justinabrahms: isn't that for qsb?
2014-01-17 11:35:26	justinabrahms	meandavejustice: doubtful. qsb would be only backlog.
2014-01-17 11:35:33	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: missing sprintly_production_cron in the roles.
2014-01-17 11:35:42	justinabrahms	meaning when running that command, we haven't been deploying to admin03
2014-01-17 11:35:53	justinabrahms	so all old cron jobs are running old code. :-/
2014-01-17 11:36:17	justinabrahms	meaning we should release again.
2014-01-17 11:36:30	nicholasserra	Gotcha. That's the command sequence I was told to run since way back. What should I be running?
2014-01-17 11:36:37	phuongie	what kind of chron jobs? disabling trial accounts, for example?
2014-01-17 11:36:40	phuongie	justinabrahms: ^
2014-01-17 11:36:41	justinabrahms	yes.
2014-01-17 11:37:13	nicholasserra	joe deployed two weeks ago, he might have updated everything
2014-01-17 11:37:21	justinabrahms	also, reminder, no more merging things into master until post-retreat cc chrisforrette meandavejustice florapdx
2014-01-17 11:37:40	florapdx	got it justinabrahms
2014-01-17 11:37:50	justinabrahms	this is my command: git checkout master && git pull && fab promote_package:snowbird && fab deploy --role=sprintly_production_app_server,sprintly_production_cron && fab bust_cache --role="sprintly_production_app_server" && fab service:apache2,start --role=sprintly_production_app_server
2014-01-17 11:38:05	justinabrahms	key difference being:  fab deploy --role=sprintly_production_app_server,sprintly_production_cron
2014-01-17 11:38:20	justinabrahms	will update the readme.
2014-01-17 11:38:25	nicholasserra	Looks good, thanks

2014-01-17 11:43:53	nicholasserra	Nice
2014-01-17 11:44:35	nicholasserra	system_tests down to one failure XD Just have that odd sub item reordering one.
2014-01-17 11:47:25	nicholasserra	Helpful hints for selenium tests: Obviously use as little actual selenium code as possible. With these new ones you can add items via the database, which makes everything much faster. Also, use selector.is_displayed() as little as possible. If the assert can just check if the element is in the DOM instead of displayed, go that route. Keep in mind that you should be testing the smallest unit of code. meandavejustice  chrisforrette  florapdx
2014-01-17 11:48:15	florapdx	Thx nicholasserra
2014-01-17 11:49:41	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: can you write that somewhere in the repo?
2014-01-17 11:49:59	justinabrahms	maybe in a README of whichever new folder you have?
2014-01-17 11:50:13	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: Yeah, I'm planning on doing a little best practice write up, since this new stuff has it's quirks.
2014-01-17 11:50:16	chrisforrette	nicholasserra: cool, thanks
2014-01-17 11:52:07	florapdx	Yeah, nicholasserra Looks like tests have moved and been restructured quite a bit, so if you could outline where things live now and any other pertinent changes in running tests, etc.
2014-01-17 11:52:37	nicholasserra	Will do :)

2014-01-17 16:13:39	meandavejustice	I like "cognitive dissonance"
2014-01-17 16:16:43	justinabrahms	Mmm. adwords doesn't support programmatic conversion tracking. Sooo good.
2014-01-17 16:20:17	justinabrahms	"cognitive dissonance" is a bit different than "i can't recognize my own biases". It's more along the lines of: I believe war is wrong. I believe my country is always right. My country is at war.   --> ignoring information about your country being at war (increasing the dissonance, which is uncomfortable) or changing the original thought to be some subset of (my country is sometimes right, war is sometimes wrong, my country is no longer at war)
2014-01-17 16:21:24	justinabrahms	see also the benjamin franklin story I told a few of you a month or so ago where some guy didn't like him, so he asked to borrow a book (which he had no social standing to say no to without being rude). The dissonance of "i don't like that guy" and "i just loaned him some of my things" was too much and the guy liked him afterward (or something akin to that).

2014-01-17 17:07:11	florapdx	justinabrahms: Do we want immutable filters set to statuses: backlog, current, complete in any view other than dashboard?
2014-01-17 17:08:27	justinabrahms	florapdx: I can't think of any. That said, I can't remember why we'd even want them on dashboard. The columns should be doing the constraining, not the master view, imo.
