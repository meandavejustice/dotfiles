2013-09-27 13:31:55	wagle	I was on top of the mountain in the middle of phoenix arizona, and watched a storm come up from *below* me...

2013-09-27 13:32:25	gbuehler	tar -xzvf foobar.tar.gz extracts on my macbook
2013-09-27 13:32:38	gbuehler	but gives "gzip: stdin: not in gzip format" on the server
2013-09-27 13:32:52	gbuehler	and md5sum is the same
2013-09-27 13:33:18	wagle	what os on the server?
2013-09-27 13:33:30	gbuehler	server is ubuntu 12.04LTS
2013-09-27 13:33:42	wagle	*boggle*
2013-09-27 13:34:03	wagle	tar is weird on the mac..  should work on the server
2013-09-27 13:34:17	gbuehler	wtf, works on a centos box
2013-09-27 13:34:30	wagle	do a file on the tarbar
2013-09-27 13:34:52	wagle	maybe its not a gzip file
2013-09-27 13:35:35	gbuehler	well why the fuck didn't it skip the z flag
2013-09-27 13:35:50	gbuehler	^^ wasn't actually gzipped
2013-09-27 13:35:55	wagle	because ubuntu is being dumbed down
2013-09-27 13:36:13	 *	wagle says cynically
2013-09-27 13:36:38	wagle	is there a file command on the server?
2013-09-27 13:37:06	gbuehler	yeah, i did a file foobar.tar.gz and it came back POSIX tar archive (GNU)

2013-09-27 13:42:34	onewheelskyward	or j
2013-09-27 13:42:39	onewheelskyward	it ignores all that shit now.
2013-09-27 13:43:23	wagle	as for how the file got created, i *think* gzip refused to gzip anything when the output ends up larger
2013-09-27 13:43:51	wagle	but i've never thoroughly tested that
2013-09-27 13:44:28	gbuehler	well when i download a gzip'd tarball from oracle, i expect it to actually be gzip'd
2013-09-27 13:44:38	onewheelskyward	Did you download it through chrome?
2013-09-27 13:44:46	onewheelskyward	Chrome munges tar/gz/bz2 file extensions

2013-09-27 15:35:55	ericholscher	i only camped on public land, but just in places with ambiguous camping laws :)
2013-09-27 15:35:58	rigel	i am super skittish about that sort of thing
2013-09-27 15:36:08	rigel	i had a terrible last day of my ride
2013-09-27 15:36:15	onewheelskyward	nice
2013-09-27 15:36:18	rigel	was going to stay at a BLM camp
2013-09-27 15:36:21	onewheelskyward	as long as you're out of the way you should be fine.
2013-09-27 15:36:25	rigel	but i got there and it was closed
2013-09-27 15:36:26	ericholscher	yea, exactly
2013-09-27 15:36:28	rigel	no water either
2013-09-27 15:36:34	rigel	otherwise i woulda stayed
2013-09-27 15:36:49	rigel	and i took a shit in the pit toilet and got splashback
2013-09-27 15:37:13	rigel	so i pushed on to eugene. that was rough.
2013-09-27 15:37:21	onewheelskyward	how many extra miles?
2013-09-27 15:37:27	rigel	30ish

2013-09-27 15:53:04	pdxleif	Is there a way of returning no results instead of "0" when doing a "SELECT COUNT(*) ..." if some/all of the joins fail?
2013-09-27 15:53:34	pdxleif	It's like I don't want COUNT to be on the top-level, but after doing a join, then count the things on one side of the join.
2013-09-27 15:58:02	jmelesky	You could wrap the select count(*) in a subquery (or cte, or whatever), and then query that with a "where count_column > 0"
2013-09-27 15:58:24	jmelesky	Wait, I'm not sure I understand the join part

2013-09-27 16:07:04	pdxleif	Instead of just 0.
2013-09-27 16:10:24	jmelesky	Then, yeah, I think you could wrap that without a problem: with c as (SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM people, widgets WHERE people.name = #{name} AND widgets.person_id = people.id) select c.count from c where c.count > 0;
2013-09-27 16:10:37	gws	you can do SELECT people.id, COUNT(*) FROM people JOIN widgets ON people.id = widgets.person_id WHERE people.name = #{name}
2013-09-27 16:10:41	gws	and check the id 
2013-09-27 16:10:42	gws	if it's null
2013-09-27 16:10:43	gws	no people
2013-09-27 16:12:04	jmelesky	gws: I think you'd need an outer join for that to work. Also a group by clause.
2013-09-27 16:12:18	gws	would a left join work?

2013-09-27 16:13:06	jmelesky	Only if you start the join from widgets, which is probably not ideal
2013-09-27 16:13:57	jmelesky	Hrm. Yeah, I don't think the join method will work terribly well
2013-09-27 16:15:11	emilyst	oh hi jmelesky 
2013-09-27 16:15:37	gws	well you'd end up with 0 results if you did a left join + group by,

2013-09-27 16:15:45	gws	which seems to fit the requirements

2013-09-27 16:16:20	onewheelskyward	emilyst it helps if you offer money
2013-09-27 16:16:22	gws	you can do SELECT people.id, COUNT(*) count FROM people LEFT JOIN widgets ON people.id = widgets.person_id WHERE people.name = #{name} GROUP BY people.id -- that worked in a table i have

2013-09-30 10:02:41	pdxleif	My (cell) phone service went out last night, too.
2013-09-30 10:02:48	pdxleif	But the 4G still worked.
2013-09-30 10:02:56	manimal	I thought one of the points of html5 was to get rid of flash

2013-09-30 10:08:26	manimal	1) they knew pretty fast, 2) the techs couldn't get out for *hours*
2013-09-30 10:08:49	manimal	which I though was a good reference for the state of our power grid

2013-09-30 10:11:43	donpdonp	so im pretty sure its just broken and needs maintenance

2013-09-30 13:25:27	pdxleif	json-ld might not necessarily be the way I would've gone about it, but it gives a way of preserving the references to schema information (which things are links, types of stuff, etc) in that conversion.
2013-09-30 13:27:15	pdxleif	json-ld seems to be designed to have stuff that looks like regular json, but you can add types and links to stuff, either in-line or in the @context section.

This requires the overhead of the server remembering which nonce values have been used until the nonce time-stamp (and hence the digest built with it) has expired, but it effectively protects against replay attacks."
