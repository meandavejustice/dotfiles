2014-01-18 13:50:04	chrisdickinson	possibly! what's up?
2014-01-18 13:50:09	chrisdickinson	yep
2014-01-18 13:50:29	JSON_voorhees	It's just a bit harder to parse without headings and stuff
2014-01-18 13:50:51	JSON_voorhees	also suprised marked isn't picking out ![]() as an img
2014-01-18 13:51:07	chrisdickinson	yeah it does some odd stuff with inline text
2014-01-18 13:51:17	chrisdickinson	rather, the lexer seems to only work on block scoped things and then it does the rest later, when it feels like it :P
2014-01-18 13:51:24	JSON_voorhees	aahh
2014-01-18 13:51:53	JSON_voorhees	so You cool with me changing that template a bit?
2014-01-18 13:53:32	chrisdickinson	what would you change (out of curiosity?)
2014-01-18 13:54:00	chrisdickinson	(also justin's is a bit odd compared to the base template: https://github.com/knode/speakers/blob/master/templates/your-name.md)
2014-01-18 13:54:00	JSON_voorhees	ehh I think i just need to run this against the actual template instead of justin's stuff
2014-01-18 13:54:11	JSON_voorhees	haha yeah that's what I just noticed
2014-01-18 13:54:25	JSON_voorhees	Gunna write this so I works with the actual template then fix his to match :)
2014-01-18 13:54:31	chrisdickinson	rad :D
2014-01-18 14:54:34	JSON_voorhees	almost there... https://gist.github.com/meandavejustice/54605756efafb2bef85e
2014-01-18 14:54:51	JSON_voorhees	just wanna parse out the avatar url
2014-01-18 14:55:03	chrisdickinson	!m
2014-01-18 14:55:05	JSON_voorhees	This may actually be able to be used elsewhere if I clean it up a bit more
2014-01-18 14:55:09	JSON_voorhees	:)
2014-01-18 14:55:10	chrisdickinson	awesome :D
