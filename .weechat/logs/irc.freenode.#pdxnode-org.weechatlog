2014-01-16 16:39:25	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work nvcexploder!
2014-01-16 16:39:54	hackygolucky	nvcexploder: so, mikeal has asked me to setup a knode in-person meetup at jsfest
2014-01-16 16:40:22	hackygolucky	we've already decided(thanks mostly to s5fs) to do a mini-summit for organizers
2014-01-16 16:40:33	hackygolucky	"talk about events from last year and what went right/wrong/etc"
2014-01-16 16:40:42	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: ah, i asked "what's the goal of this meetup?"
2014-01-16 16:40:45	hackygolucky	invite everyone who's interested in starting one.
2014-01-16 16:40:46	nvcexploder	awesome!!!
2014-01-16 16:40:53	hackygolucky	or contributing
2014-01-16 16:40:59	hackygolucky	or who help run confs
2014-01-16 16:41:02	nvcexploder	I'm definitely interested
2014-01-16 16:41:03	chrisdickinson	which... it sounds like is being answered.
2014-01-16 16:41:14	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: well, I'm running with this so far
2014-01-16 16:41:16	hackygolucky	room for suggestions
2014-01-16 16:41:31	hackygolucky	just need to get back to mikeal fast because he wants to add it to the schedule.
2014-01-16 16:41:37	hackygolucky	and he doesn't know the verbage
2014-01-16 16:42:12	s5fs	hackygolucky: how many days will you be down at jsfest
2014-01-16 16:42:19	s5fs	i see its like a week long or something
2014-01-16 16:42:52	chrisdickinson	i mean, if you enjoy meta things, use the pdxnode presentation format
2014-01-16 16:43:13	chrisdickinson	(neuë-style)
2014-01-16 16:43:18	hackygolucky	s5fs: I'm there the 5th-whatever that Sunday is
2014-01-16 16:43:25	Wraithan	yo dawg, I heard you like meetups, so I am going to run this meetup meetup like a regular meetup
2014-01-16 16:43:38	hackygolucky	I planned on working out of the office and helping out during setup, whatever else
2014-01-16 16:43:47	s5fs	yeah i'm not sure i'm going
2014-01-16 16:43:57	s5fs	too many days, too busy already this year, no sponsor paying my way
2014-01-16 16:44:06	chrisdickinson	lightning talk on a small event like a nodebots instance, short talk on a meetup, long talk on organizing a conference
2014-01-16 16:44:08	hackygolucky	oh I'm not using work funds for this
2014-01-16 16:44:10	s5fs	i don't have PTO or anything
2014-01-16 16:44:22	hackygolucky	I considered it an investment in learning about conf running from Mikeal
2014-01-16 16:44:33	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: yes!
2014-01-16 16:45:05	nvcexploder	!m chrisdickinson
2014-01-16 16:45:05	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work chrisdickinson!
2014-01-16 16:45:30	chrisdickinson	also we should probably get stickers before that point :|
2014-01-16 16:45:36	chrisdickinson	so much to do, so little time
2014-01-16 16:46:18	hackygolucky	chrisdickinson: oh I had already written on my hand earlier today to talk to you about ALL the stickers
2014-01-16 16:46:30	Wraithan	oh man
2014-01-16 16:46:31	 *	hackygolucky lifts hand and waves across the aisle
2014-01-16 16:46:32	Wraithan	ya
2014-01-16 16:46:34	Wraithan	stickers
2014-01-16 16:46:46	Wraithan	I would like bunches of them for my laptop and such
2014-01-16 16:47:06	nvcexploder	and my face. I want stickers. on. my. face.
2014-01-16 16:47:12	hackygolucky	face tattoo
2014-01-16 16:47:23	hackygolucky	JSON_voorheez: ^^
2014-01-16 16:47:26	nvcexploder	EVEN BETTERRRRRRRR
2014-01-16 16:47:34	JSON_voorheez	consider it done
2014-01-16 16:47:40	 *	hackygolucky is wondering who would be a relevant sponsor for this event...
2014-01-16 16:47:46	hackygolucky	super community driven
2014-01-16 16:47:53	hackygolucky	it's going to be AT joyent.
2014-01-16 16:49:35	JSON_voorheez	Not sure if any of you have heard, but there is a new JavaScript meetup starting up this month
2014-01-16 16:49:38	JSON_voorheez	here in pdx
2014-01-16 16:49:48	nvcexploder	cool! what is it?
2014-01-16 16:50:39	hackygolucky	I feel like we're about to be rick-rolled.
2014-01-16 16:50:43	JSON_voorheez	It's a bunch of people from Instrument I belive
2014-01-16 16:50:45	JSON_voorheez	haha
2014-01-16 16:50:47	JSON_voorheez	nah
2014-01-16 16:51:07	hackygolucky	what... are they focusing on?
2014-01-16 16:51:10	JSON_voorheez	they are calling it craftedJs
2014-01-16 16:51:23	JSON_voorheez	they are modelling it after bkJs
2014-01-16 16:51:37	JSON_voorheez	so essentially a once a month miniconf kinda thing
2014-01-16 16:51:59	hackygolucky	why wouldn't they just revamp JS Admirers?
2014-01-16 16:52:05	hackygolucky	as PDXJS
2014-01-16 16:52:19	s5fs	haha!!
2014-01-16 16:52:21	JSON_voorheez	not sure, I assume they don't want to deal with bullshit
2014-01-16 16:52:24	s5fs	NEW PLAN
2014-01-16 16:52:27	hackygolucky	there isn't any bullshit
2014-01-16 16:52:32	hackygolucky	jesse and luc are awesome
2014-01-16 16:52:33	JSON_voorheez	Which I don't blame them
2014-01-16 16:52:34	s5fs	infiltrate JS Admirers and take over from the inside
2014-01-16 16:52:35	hackygolucky	and really ncie.
2014-01-16 16:52:40	JSON_voorheez	Oh I don't know them
2014-01-16 16:52:46	hackygolucky	and need help
2014-01-16 16:52:47	hackygolucky	actually
2014-01-16 16:53:01	JSON_voorheez	Just saying that starting your own thang is easier in some ways
2014-01-16 16:53:30	JSON_voorheez	They don't have to have to deal with existing policies and stuff. They can just do what they want
2014-01-16 16:53:42	s5fs	I do what I wan'
2014-01-16 16:53:56	hackygolucky	sounds like it'll be a good time.
2014-01-16 16:54:01	hackygolucky	I really want to attend bkjs
2014-01-16 16:54:05	JSON_voorheez	me too
2014-01-16 16:54:06	hackygolucky	I just feel bad for js admirers
2014-01-16 16:54:09	s5fs	bkjs?
2014-01-16 16:54:11	JSON_voorheez	its so bad
2014-01-16 16:54:18	JSON_voorheez	brooklynJS
2014-01-16 16:54:29	s5fs	ah
2014-01-16 16:54:36	JSON_voorheez	to clarify bkjs == not bad
2014-01-16 16:54:44	JSON_voorheez	js admirers == so bad
2014-01-16 16:54:52	JSON_voorheez	from my couple of experiences that is
2014-01-16 16:54:57	hackygolucky	no one has helped them or suggested differently to them!
2014-01-16 16:55:07	 *	hackygolucky feels guilty herself for not helping
2014-01-16 16:55:16	hackygolucky	thus the negativity.
2014-01-16 16:55:32	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky: you have plenty of stuff going on
2014-01-16 16:55:45	JSON_voorheez	your not responsible for their stuff suckin
2014-01-16 16:55:47	hackygolucky	if someone else started a node user group here and hadn't hung out with us much, I would be sad. Not mad.
2014-01-16 16:55:54	JSON_voorheez	yeah
2014-01-16 16:55:58	hackygolucky	it's a bummer.
2014-01-16 16:56:03	JSON_voorheez	I agree
2014-01-16 16:57:18	s5fs	i think 'admirers' is a goofy term
2014-01-16 16:57:34	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: it feels pretty acurate for the crowd though
2014-01-16 16:57:36	s5fs	i almost didn't attend my first meeting due to the name
2014-01-16 16:57:49	JSON_voorheez	A lot of them seem to admire from afar
2014-01-16 16:58:05	JSON_voorheez	which is a thing i've said like 190323920 times now so sorry for that
2014-01-16 16:58:31	JSON_voorheez	We luckily don't have that problem with pdxnode
2014-01-16 16:58:35	s5fs	i figure it's all front-enders
2014-01-16 16:58:37	JSON_voorheez	for the most part
2014-01-16 16:58:55	hackygolucky	alright, now I need to come up with good verbage for the event.
2014-01-16 16:59:07	nvcexploder	MEETGROUPLEARNPRESENTGO
2014-01-16 16:59:12	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: well this was more people being completely clueless

2014-01-16 17:03:39	s5fs	haha, for the knode.io site can we build a regional 'shopping cart' where you can add speakers to your cart and then checkout, which sends them invites to speak at an event?

2014-01-16 17:05:31	hackygolucky	or something like that.
2014-01-16 17:05:35	chrisdickinson	sorry, doing the thing where i have lots of conversations
2014-01-16 17:05:54	chrisdickinson	wow, that was a hilariously asinine sentence
2014-01-16 17:06:36	chrisdickinson	rephrasing: "just getting done with a documentation discussion"
2014-01-16 17:07:11	nvcexploder	rephrasing: "just woke up, what?"

2014-01-16 17:14:14	hackygolucky	it's goofy, but it fits us.
2014-01-16 17:16:46	hackygolucky	I think we say node community too many times in it though.
2014-01-16 17:17:37	nvcexploder	"growing their local node --"
2014-01-16 17:17:44	hackygolucky	heh

2014-01-17 20:41:41	hackygolucky	but I have to break the list out in a better way.

2014-01-17 22:13:50	hackygolucky	or just tell me 'STAHP' and I'll wait until I hear from you tomorrow before releasing it.
2014-01-17 22:14:38	s5fs	dlmanning: okay my arm feels better now
2014-01-17 22:18:04	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky: we might nix the questions page stuff for now i think
2014-01-17 22:18:17	chrisdickinson	we can just link to the repo + create a readme describing how to use the questions repo
2014-01-17 22:18:28	hackygolucky	ok
2014-01-17 22:18:29	chrisdickinson	re: meetups + speakers: those can be unified as "create a package that, given a list of items with locations, can plot those locations + some metadata on a map" (i.e., one task can represent both pages)
2014-01-17 22:19:20	chrisdickinson	ah!
2014-01-17 22:19:22	chrisdickinson	yeah
2014-01-17 22:19:36	chrisdickinson	i have a bad habit of scrolling to the bottom of lists and then reading up :|
2014-01-17 22:21:01	hackygolucky	heh
2014-01-17 22:21:05	hackygolucky	so wait
2014-01-17 22:21:12	hackygolucky	don't do that?
2014-01-17 22:21:40	chrisdickinson	the thing i just said -- you have it represented above as "create map of locations in json stream"
2014-01-17 22:22:09	chrisdickinson	(under "miscellaneous but important")
2014-01-17 22:25:56	hackygolucky	yup
2014-01-17 22:25:57	hackygolucky	ok
2014-01-17 22:25:58	hackygolucky	:)
2014-01-17 22:27:55	hackygolucky	might want to refresh
2014-01-17 22:28:01	hackygolucky	but there aren't too many changes
2014-01-17 22:30:49	chrisdickinson	what template language do we want to use?
2014-01-17 22:32:38	s5fs	something xml-based, dare to be different
2014-01-17 22:32:50	hackygolucky	I have no opinions
2014-01-17 22:32:54	hackygolucky	on this matter
2014-01-17 22:32:59	hackygolucky	erp
2014-01-17 22:33:02	hackygolucky	I take that back
2014-01-17 22:33:03	hackygolucky	:)
2014-01-17 22:33:08	chrisdickinson	hah
2014-01-17 22:33:17	hackygolucky	whatever is easiest for lots of people to help develop on
2014-01-17 22:33:24	hackygolucky	but also isn't batshit crazy
2014-01-17 22:33:59	 *	hackygolucky wishes there was a website that allowed me to choose those options as filters and poop out the tpl I want
2014-01-17 22:34:00	hackygolucky	:)
2014-01-17 22:38:08	hackygolucky	Question!
2014-01-17 22:38:15	chrisdickinson	what's up?
2014-01-17 22:38:27	hackygolucky	oh, I'm a dummy
2014-01-17 22:39:24	hackygolucky	I was going to ask: if multiple people have access to the server a project is running on, how you share that info with other people who are contributing...
2014-01-17 22:39:32	hackygolucky	in case the server has fallen over.
2014-01-17 22:39:33	hackygolucky	but
2014-01-17 22:39:42	hackygolucky	we don't have that problem with knode
2014-01-17 22:39:52	hackygolucky	since it is all on gh-pages
2014-01-17 22:42:55	hackygolucky	okey dokey.
2014-01-17 22:42:57	hackygolucky	So.
2014-01-17 22:43:03	hackygolucky	My headache has come back
2014-01-17 22:43:11	hackygolucky	which means I'm heading back to bed
2014-01-17 22:43:43	hackygolucky	If any of you lovely people would read through the most updated https://gist.github.com/hackygolucky/8486118
2014-01-17 22:43:44	chrisdickinson	cool! feel better!
2014-01-17 22:43:53	hackygolucky	that would be super swell. And comment please!
2014-01-17 22:44:00	hackygolucky	I'll update it in the morning before I share it
2014-01-17 22:44:16	hackygolucky	and I'll see you guys tomorrow hacking, most likely, at Bare Bones. I just need sleep.
2014-01-17 22:44:40	hackygolucky	thanks!
