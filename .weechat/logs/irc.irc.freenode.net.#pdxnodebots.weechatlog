2013-07-12 12:39:11	s5fs	hackygolucky_: yeah, i was thinking about it on the way to work. also, when can we access the space and when do we need to have it cleared out?
2013-07-12 12:39:41	s5fs	also, is it possible to survey the space ahead of time? we'll need to identify # of power outlets and find/buy enough power strips to make the space livable
2013-07-12 12:43:27	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I will talk to our facilities coordinator and see what she can do. I might have to go during work hours with her to get that done.
2013-07-12 12:46:03	s5fs	hackygolucky_: cool, i'm here to help if you need an extra body
2013-07-12 12:46:20	hackygolucky_	excellent.
2013-07-12 12:46:58	s5fs	hackygolucky_: also, we need to nail down the kits we're buying asap, esp if we expect to source parts from china. we're two weeks out and still no concrete plan, makes me a bit nervous.
2013-07-12 12:47:42	s5fs	hackygolucky_: if you know the budget for the gear i can begin assembling kit suggestions and project ideas
2013-07-12 12:48:36	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I thought that's what we'd nail down on Tuesday :-/
2013-07-12 12:48:53	hackygolucky_	when I asked nexxy about deadlines before she said that would be plenty of time.
2013-07-12 12:48:55	hackygolucky_	hrm.
2013-07-12 12:49:02	s5fs	hackygolucky_: okay sounds good, i wasn't certain if we  had a budget already
2013-07-12 12:50:59	s5fs	hackygolucky_: thats well and good but i'm concerned about the timeline. assuming we agree upon a budget on tues, how much time will it take to select a kit and project ideas? i'm guessing another 1-2 days, so lets say we can place an order next thurs/fri. that's cutting it extremely close and we're going to have to ship from within the US.
2013-07-12 12:51:46	s5fs	someone has to receive the gear and build out the projects, hone instructions, etc. there's still a great deal of work to do, assuming we wish to tackle these items :)
2013-07-12 12:52:32	hackygolucky_	oh I think we already have budget. Or just need to lock it down.. Tuesday was for getting the hardware list SET so nexxy can order.
2013-07-12 12:52:42	hackygolucky_	and also to work on the day-of-event happenings.
2013-07-12 12:53:26	s5fs	perfecto
2013-07-12 12:54:05	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I think we've got a total budget of $2000 for the event thanks to sponsors.
2013-07-12 12:54:21	hackygolucky_	so basically just hardware, snack, and drinks
2013-07-12 12:54:53	JSON_voorhees	+ goat
2013-07-12 12:55:08	hackygolucky_	ah yes.
2013-07-12 13:07:02	s5fs	hackygolucky_: right, i wish to understand how much of that $2k is available for hw. we can rough estimate drinks/snacks pretty easily but other things like stickers, raffle cards or furniture rentals will eat into the budget.
2013-07-12 13:07:26	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i belive we're thinking along the same lines :)
2013-07-12 13:07:33	hackygolucky_	ahl so I can't take a look at the building until next week, but we have a ton of tables and chairs
2013-07-12 13:07:42	hackygolucky_	just confirmed.
2013-07-12 13:08:01	hackygolucky_	s5fs: stickers are on the way unless we want to custom make some for PDX
2013-07-12 13:08:13	hackygolucky_	from NodeBots organizers and jden(I think)
2013-07-12 13:08:29	s5fs	hackygolucky_: awesome!
2013-07-12 13:08:39	hackygolucky_	The NodeBots peeps just asked for an organizers address for each city, so I gave them mine.

2013-07-14 15:50:21	thoward	i have an idea. :)
2013-07-14 15:51:12	thoward	so in the urban airship space, there's a couple extra conference room areas which are fairly large, and separate from the main meeting room.
2013-07-14 15:51:49	thoward	someone on twitter was talking about how they thought it would be a good idea to offer childcare at conferences to enable more parents to attend who might otherwise not.
2013-07-14 15:51:57	thoward	i was thinking it would be cool to setup a kids room for this.
2013-07-14 15:52:31	thoward	when i go to events at UA i always stick my kids in the conference room with a bunch of dry erase markers and let them play with the whiteboards in there. that keeps them in a quiet place so they aren't disturbing the presentations and keeps them busy.
2013-07-14 15:52:39	thoward	they can do that mostly unattended.
2013-07-14 15:54:29	<--	ridicter (~ridicter@66.96.79.211) has quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
2013-07-14 15:57:06	thoward	i was thiking we couldl get some robot-related projects for them to do as well. even if it's just some snapcircuits, or a model of R2D2 they can glue together, or whatever.

2013-07-14 15:57:22	thoward	and i could find one or two people to hang out in the kids room all day (non-tech folks)
2013-07-14 15:57:51	thoward	i think that would be pretty awesome.
2013-07-14 15:57:57	thoward	i know my kids would love it
2013-07-14 15:58:08	thoward	and probably jake's as wlel
2013-07-14 15:58:12	Wraithan	thoward: offering child care is a bit tricky
2013-07-14 15:58:23	thoward	it's not exactly "offering childcare"
2013-07-14 15:58:27	thoward	just making a kids room
2013-07-14 15:59:34	thoward	anyhow -- my wife actually has a certification for professional childcare, and we know a couple other people who do as well (at one time we were considering doing a childcare/chinese tutoring thing at our house, never happened, but she did get the cert)
2013-07-14 16:00:49	thoward	it's up the parents how they want to deal with their kids, basically. if they want to be int he room w/ them they can, or if the kids are indpendent enough, they can leave them be.
2013-07-14 16:01:05	thoward	the adults that are in there would be there to facilitate the kid projects
2013-07-14 16:01:12	thoward	not to provide "chlidcare"
2013-07-14 16:01:27	Wraithan	Ah, then yea, you know the diff if she has the cert
2013-07-14 16:01:31	thoward	(an important distinction w/ the law)
2013-07-14 16:01:36	Wraithan	Exactly
2013-07-14 16:03:14	thoward	anyhow.. i think it would fun, and i'd be willing to organize that bit. i have some snap circuits i could bring in
2013-07-14 16:03:56	thoward	anyone have any lego robots stuff?
2013-07-14 16:09:41	thoward	we can make our own R2D2 popsicles with this: http://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Star-Wars-R2D2-Silicone/dp/B004UB73FK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1373843345&sr=8-1&keywords=r2d2+star+wars

2013-07-16 12:01:35	nexxy	if you plan on using the restroom while @ bridgeport brewery (which is on the second floor)
2013-07-16 12:01:39	nexxy	don't wear a skirt
2013-07-16 12:01:58	nexxy	the platform you have to walk across to get there is just metal grating that people below you can see right through
2013-07-16 12:02:22	thoward	!m nexxy
2013-07-16 12:02:23	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work nexxy!
2013-07-16 12:02:35	thoward	we should send you in to do recon before every meeting. :)
2013-07-16 12:02:54	nexxy	lol
2013-07-16 12:02:59	nexxy	oh yeahhhh
2013-07-16 12:03:47	nexxy	thoward, did I tell you that I spoke with Mark?
2013-07-16 12:03:51	nexxy	no I don't think I did
2013-07-16 12:03:55	s5fs	nexxy: shit, of course today is the day I chose to wear a skirt
2013-07-16 12:04:19	nexxy	s5fs, good call
2013-07-16 12:04:22	nexxy	it's nice and breezy today
2013-07-16 12:04:49	s5fs	i prefer a nice cottony summer dress over a utilikilt
2013-07-16 12:04:55	nexxy	for sure
2013-07-16 12:04:58	nexxy	way more breathable
2013-07-16 12:04:59	s5fs	but let's be honest, who doesn't?
2013-07-16 12:05:04	thoward	nexxy: you told me it was a-coming. how'd it go? my guess is "You're awesome, but they don't need another TE in the PacNW."
2013-07-16 12:05:15	nexxy	yes but
2013-07-16 12:05:23	nexxy	I am mostly interested in engineering anyway
2013-07-16 12:05:33	s5fs	same, but mostly for the hats and boots
2013-07-16 12:05:44	nexxy	thoward, but I did mention to him that
2013-07-16 12:05:52	nexxy	they should hire you as well
2013-07-16 12:05:53	thoward	s5fs: layering is key. don't prefer the dress over the kilt, WEAR the dress over the kilt. duh.
2013-07-16 12:05:54	nexxy	FWIW
2013-07-16 12:05:58	nexxy	(probably nothing)
2013-07-16 12:06:07	nexxy	thoward, hahaha
2013-07-16 12:06:23	s5fs	thoward: and top the whole thing with a poncho

2013-07-16 12:08:15	nexxy	thoward, well mark did say he was going to forward my resume to engineering, but chris already has it too so we'll see
2013-07-16 12:08:24	s5fs	thoward: now you're just being silly

2013-07-17 11:23:14	hackygolucky_	oooh. have fun!
2013-07-17 11:33:59	s5fs	hi everyone
2013-07-17 11:34:37	hackygolucky_	s5fs: hey hey hey
2013-07-17 13:31:22	<--	ZenWraithBot (~zenwraith@216.151.13.75) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-07-17 14:15:33	hackygolucky_	nexxy: this is the wishlist.  http://sfe.io/w66734
2013-07-17 14:15:38	hackygolucky_	already shared it with thoward
2013-07-17 14:15:51	hackygolucky_	I guess we need to coordinate when/how/what is officially being purchased.
2013-07-17 14:16:07	hackygolucky_	Ambitiously, that would be today. Post-interviews for you guys, I guess?
2013-07-17 14:16:25	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i'll review it right meow
2013-07-17 14:16:44	hackygolucky_	s5fs: thanks!
2013-07-17 14:16:53	hackygolucky_	even with the discount, it is still overbudget.
2013-07-17 14:17:02	hackygolucky_	so if you can think of ways to trim it down, PLEASE do.
2013-07-17 14:17:16	hackygolucky_	we could get more cool stuff that way i.e. servos, sensors, what-not
2013-07-17 14:17:40	s5fs	hackygolucky_: is this price after the 20% discount?
2013-07-17 14:17:43	hackygolucky_	as it stands that was essentially basic kits for 40 people plus a very few fun add-ons to play with.
2013-07-17 14:17:49	hackygolucky_	s5fs: nope, before.
2013-07-17 14:17:57	hackygolucky_	you can't put the discount in until you are checking out.
2013-07-17 14:18:01	s5fs	ok
2013-07-17 14:18:13	hackygolucky_	yeah, heart attack central.
2013-07-17 14:18:49	s5fs	right off the top we can reduce the # of wire kits we need by half. 30 wires is more than enough for one simple project, we could probably even do 1 wire kit for three arduinos
2013-07-17 14:19:18	s5fs	i'd also order a bunch of LEDs and the correct resistors, those tend to get killed easily
2013-07-17 14:20:25	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I think math-wise I calculated 6 wires per arduino for the order.
2013-07-17 14:20:35	hackygolucky_	oh, nope. 10
2013-07-17 14:21:57	s5fs	hackygolucky_: nice! i like your planning style, yo
2013-07-17 14:22:31	hackygolucky_	ditto.
2013-07-17 14:22:59	hackygolucky_	I think thoward and I talked about maybe pushing the number of kits down a little more so more people would have to pair, but we'd stay under budget and have a few cool bits.
2013-07-17 14:27:09	s5fs	i'm okay with pairing up
2013-07-17 14:29:49	hackygolucky_	okay. So maybe drop it down to 35 kits and see where that lands us?
2013-07-17 14:29:55	 *	hackygolucky_ goes to adjust the list
2013-07-17 14:30:09	adamdicarlo	i'm guessing I'll need to pair up... I don't know so much about putting together resistors and such...
2013-07-17 14:30:49	hackygolucky_	aw, darn it. I didn't realize the total counts were wipe when I moved it over to wishlist from cart.
2013-07-17 14:30:56	hackygolucky_	well fart on sparkfun.
2013-07-17 14:31:46	s5fs	hackygolucky_: that's okay, we can source some of the parts cheaper elsewhere (like bare arduinos)
2013-07-17 14:33:41	hackygolucky_	s5fs: so knocking it down to 35 kits but keeping the fun bits brings us right at budget.
2013-07-17 14:33:48	hackygolucky_	on Sparkfun.
2013-07-17 14:43:24	s5fs	hackygolucky_: awesome, that's getting way closer
2013-07-17 14:46:41	hackygolucky_	yup yup
2013-07-17 14:47:12	hackygolucky_	we could drop it *just* a few more and get some REALLY fun toys, like a few chassis or servos or whatever you guys dream up.
2013-07-17 14:50:42	randallagordon	GymnastBot, anyone? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M0jhAuAuJI

2013-07-17 14:57:14	JSON_voorhees	hey guys I was able to find a spare harddrive for that extra minimac last night. I gunna set it up as a file server and our local npm tonight.
2013-07-17 14:57:42	chrisdickinson	sweet
2013-07-17 14:58:35	hackygolucky_	!m JSON_voorhees
2013-07-17 14:58:58	adamdicarlo	that robot absolutely stuck that landing
2013-07-17 15:00:30	s5fs	JSON_voorhees: good luck, holler if you get stuck with the npm stuff. i struggled and never got it working, make sure you have the right version of couch)
2013-07-17 15:01:37	JSON_voorhees	s5fs: will do
2013-07-17 15:01:40	chrisdickinson	also: npm.im/npmd
2013-07-17 15:01:49	JSON_voorhees	for sure
2013-07-17 15:02:10	JSON_voorhees	started putting together a list of modules to post for people to have before hand...
2013-07-17 15:02:46	JSON_voorhees	I kind of assume that most people attending will already have most of them tho
2013-07-17 15:04:39	s5fs	hard to say. if you can get the private npm repo working, it'll be nbd. if not, we should try to get npmd working.
2013-07-17 15:04:43	s5fs	chrisdickinson: have you used npmd before? i know you mentioned it and i hadn't heard of it before
2013-07-17 15:04:54	s5fs	randallagordon: hey man!
2013-07-17 15:05:00	chrisdickinson	i haven't really used it, just heard a lot about it at nodeconf
2013-07-17 15:05:13	chrisdickinson	wow, only a few billions deps
2013-07-17 15:05:24	chrisdickinson	s/ns d/n d/g
2013-07-17 15:05:32	s5fs	gotcha
2013-07-17 15:05:52	chrisdickinson	installing now
2013-07-17 15:05:55	chrisdickinson	and syncing
2013-07-17 15:05:56	s5fs	cool
2013-07-17 15:06:25	s5fs	chrisdickinson: so, when we install npmd do we point clients at the npmd host (similar to using a private repo?)
2013-07-17 15:06:59	chrisdickinson	i think it might be a matter of running `--sync` beforehand -- and then it'll quickly install things out of cache
2013-07-17 15:07:19	chrisdickinson	so you can do `npmd install browserify --greedy` and it'll install browserify from cache without making any network connection
2013-07-17 15:07:30	chrisdickinson	i might have been mistaken about him using crdt/scuttlebutt
2013-07-17 15:07:36	chrisdickinson	this seems like more of a leveldb project
2013-07-17 15:09:21	s5fs	chrisdickinson: hm. so npmd is really better to install on each client than on a single server? the readme isn't super descriptive.
2013-07-17 15:10:03	chrisdickinson	i think in the "accelerating the heat death of the universe" sense, it's probably better to have a single server
2013-07-17 15:10:18	chrisdickinson	as i'm not sure if you can sync from peers
2013-07-17 15:12:45	s5fs	okay, so assuming JSON_voorhees can get the private npm repo working, we should be good to go. i also hope/expect wifi to be fairly solid
2013-07-17 15:25:40	adamdicarlo	s5fs, hackygolucky_, did you guys check element14?
2013-07-17 15:25:53	hackygolucky_	oh, nope.
2013-07-17 15:25:55	adamdicarlo	i asked my arduino nerd friend about places that sell robotics stuff.
2013-07-17 15:26:03	adamdicarlo	that was his suggestion. not sure if they'd be cheaper.
2013-07-17 15:27:08	hackygolucky_	they don't look too far off in price, but this is great to keep in mind. Thanks adamdicarlo !
2013-07-17 15:27:31	adamdicarlo	sure.

2013-07-17 19:49:46	thoward	Wraithan: any word on Moz sponsor?  hackygolucky_ said you were confirmed "one way or the other" but. upfront check-in-hand sponsorship is mo-better than deferred re-imbursement sponsorships.
2013-07-17 19:51:02	Wraithan	thoward: no confirmation, waiting to hear back on something I sent today, either way I plan on buying it on my card then expensing, WAY easier than getting a check

2013-07-17 20:06:51	nexxy	omg
2013-07-17 20:07:03	nexxy	looking @ sparkfun's prices kinda makes me a little bit mad
2013-07-17 20:07:13	nexxy	some of these are ridiculous
2013-07-17 20:07:20	nexxy	$1.50 per photoresistor
2013-07-17 20:07:21	nexxy	wtf
2013-07-17 20:07:56	nexxy	the arduinos are also ridiculously overpriced
2013-07-17 20:09:04	nexxy	sainsmart SMD arduino uno R3 WITH CABLE on amazon -- $17.50
2013-07-17 20:09:10	nexxy	no 20% discount necessary.
2013-07-17 20:09:19	nexxy	WITH CABLE
2013-07-17 20:09:25	nexxy	half the price
2013-07-17 20:09:30	 *	nexxy shakes fist
2013-07-17 20:09:48	nexxy	also free shipping cuz amazon prime
2013-07-17 20:09:52	nexxy	so WTF sparkfun
2013-07-17 20:09:53	nexxy	wtf
2013-07-17 20:09:58	hackygolucky_	nexxy if we can source enough of thembwhy not just get the sainsmart?
2013-07-17 20:10:04	nexxy	we can
2013-07-17 20:10:05	nexxy	and we shall
2013-07-17 20:10:28	nexxy	http://amzn.to/13SRAPN
2013-07-17 20:11:04	nexxy	and I have 9-10 of these exact units already
2013-07-17 20:11:16	hackygolucky_	Nice! How'd the interview go?
2013-07-17 20:11:18	nexxy	so so if we order 30 we will have 40+
2013-07-17 20:11:23	nexxy	it was quite involved
2013-07-17 20:11:31	nexxy	got there @ 8:50, left @ 5:40
2013-07-17 20:11:41	nexxy	interviewed with 9 people
2013-07-17 20:12:19	hackygolucky_	Also thoward they didn't give me the check. Everyone able to approve the check was out :( but they were ready to cut it. They'll have it tomorrow. Sigh.
2013-07-17 20:12:54	hackygolucky_	nexxy: yeah. That's horribly normal now I think.
2013-07-17 20:13:08	nexxy	it was pretty cool
2013-07-17 20:13:11	nexxy	everyone was great
2013-07-17 20:13:18	nexxy	the feedback I got was pretty positive

2013-07-17 20:16:35	nexxy	thoward, yep!
2013-07-17 20:16:53	nexxy	he was the easiest interview :D we just talked about some of my projects and about how amazing node is
2013-07-17 20:17:17	thoward	did you encourage him to come be part of nodebots day? :)
2013-07-17 20:17:25	nexxy	yes!
2013-07-17 20:17:29	thoward	awesome!

2013-07-17 20:17:42	nexxy	it was already on his schedule
2013-07-17 20:17:44	thoward	i've been sitting here listening to him talk about hardware for awhile
2013-07-17 20:17:48	nexxy	there are some new relic people signed up
2013-07-17 20:17:53	nexxy	and I talked to a gentleman that is very excited

2013-07-17 20:18:19	thoward	ward in the background, misc CS papers in the fore-ground. i mostly just like to listen to his voice. it's really relaxing
2013-07-17 20:18:22	Wraithan	I have a rpi and a teensy
2013-07-17 20:18:32	Wraithan	I should buy the parts for the little media keyboard I wanna build
2013-07-17 20:18:57	nexxy	ooh Wraithan ty for reminding me about the teensy
2013-07-17 20:19:26	thoward	nexxy: did oyu ever get teensy working for johnny5 ?
2013-07-17 20:19:38	thoward	i thought there wa some prob w/ usb->serial or something
2013-07-17 20:19:44	Wraithan	http://pad.wraithan.net/p/media-keys
2013-07-17 20:19:49	nexxy	thoward, no :(
2013-07-17 20:19:54	nexxy	yeah that's the issue
2013-07-17 20:19:59	nexxy	it's liek, real USB
2013-07-17 20:20:01	nexxy	not just
2013-07-17 20:20:01	thoward	if so, then fuck we should buy that for the meetup
2013-07-17 20:20:03	nexxy	serial over USB
2013-07-17 20:20:21	nexxy	but there are some problems with the teensy
2013-07-17 20:20:30	nexxy	1) not as proto friendly (no headers)
2013-07-17 20:20:38	nexxy	2) tiny & a little awkward for fat fingers
2013-07-17 20:20:47	nexxy	3) same cost as sainsmart R3 but w/o cable

2013-07-18 11:17:30	hackygolucky_	thoward s5fs nexxy how'd the purchase party go? :P
2013-07-18 11:20:40	thoward	hackygolucky_: we got tired and aborted mission.
2013-07-18 11:20:52	thoward	but we got the list ready to roll for today
2013-07-18 11:20:59	hackygolucky_	well that's fair. I couldn't stay awake.
2013-07-18 11:21:14	hackygolucky_	sooo much going on right now.
2013-07-18 11:21:28	hackygolucky_	you guys both had to do the interview stuff too. Whew.
2013-07-18 11:21:31	hackygolucky_	Brain drain.
2013-07-18 11:23:20	thoward	yup
2013-07-18 11:23:41	thoward	also, i misplaced my debit card for the account. :)
2013-07-18 11:24:15	thoward	which shouldn't have been a problem since it was already on the aws account, but then it wanted to confirm it and i couldn't find the thing to punch the number in..
2013-07-18 11:24:23	thoward	so now i need to find the damned card to finish it up.
2013-07-18 11:25:00	thoward	amazon used to let you pay by echeck/bank account as well, but even though that option is avaiable on my personal account, it's not on the nodepdx amazon account. dunno why. discontinued that payment method?
2013-07-18 11:25:02	hackygolucky_	oof.
2013-07-18 11:25:08	thoward	also, i have paypal setup, but amazon doesn't take that.
2013-07-18 11:25:22	thoward	so i need to either find the card, or go to the bank and get a new one this morning.
2013-07-18 11:25:27	hackygolucky_	of course not. Amazon.
2013-07-18 11:25:31	thoward	grumble grumble
2013-07-18 11:25:41	thoward	i just used it like, last week too.
2013-07-18 11:49:07	Wraithan	Ok, all of the parts are ordered for my media keyboard
2013-07-18 11:49:16	Wraithan	looking forward to playing with ti
2013-07-18 11:49:29	Wraithan	got multiple of all the parts
2013-07-18 11:49:47	Wraithan	partially because I want to end up with 2 of them, partially so I can accidently destroy things
2013-07-18 11:50:22	Wraithan	I have enough to build 3 of them

2013-07-18 14:11:05	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i assume it's up on calagator?
2013-07-18 14:11:13	hackygolucky_	s5fs: should be...
2013-07-18 14:11:15	hackygolucky_	hrm
2013-07-18 14:11:23	hackygolucky_	I forget calagator sometimes...
2013-07-18 14:11:37	s5fs	hackygolucky_: okay well where is the meetup saturday? i can remember things sometimes.
2013-07-18 14:11:48	hackygolucky_	it's also on meetup
2013-07-18 14:11:52	hackygolucky_	but 26 cafe.
2013-07-18 14:11:57	hackygolucky_	I'll post it on calagator anyway.
2013-07-18 14:11:59	hackygolucky_	I should be doing that.
2013-07-18 14:12:09	s5fs	nexxy: is your color sensor business up on github? is that part of the schematic you were showing me last night?
2013-07-18 14:12:18	s5fs	hackygolucky_: okay cool, thanks
2013-07-18 14:16:26	nexxy	s5fs, yeah
2013-07-18 14:16:42	nexxy	https://github.com/nexxy/color-sensor
2013-07-18 14:17:13	s5fs	chrisdickinson: are you wanting to build the solution on saturday or just review the work to date?
2013-07-18 14:17:58	chrisdickinson	i was hoping to run through the solution and get an idea of how it all worked so i could draw up some instructions
2013-07-18 14:18:53	s5fs	nexxy: i'll see how much gear i have but may ping you for enough crap to build the color-sensor. i have momentary switches i can use in lieu of the ultrasonic as well
2013-07-18 14:18:59	s5fs	chrisdickinson: ^^
2013-07-18 14:19:42	s5fs	chrisdickinson: i haven't built this solution before either so it'll be a good experiment. if time allows i wanna whip out a simple led hello world too.
2013-07-18 14:19:48	chrisdickinson	sounds great
2013-07-18 14:20:33	s5fs	chrisdickinson: worst case, we have coffee and hang with the pyladies
2013-07-18 14:21:08	chrisdickinson	sounds great-EPSILON
2013-07-18 14:21:32	nexxy	s5fs, we will need to make a fork o the code too
2013-07-18 14:21:53	nexxy	and a different wiring diagram
2013-07-18 14:22:27	s5fs	nexxy: no worries
2013-07-18 14:43:24	JSON_voorhees	nexxy: is this going to be the beginner track? looks coool
2013-07-18 15:00:36	s5fs	JSON_voorhees: no, i don't think we bought tricolor leds for the 'basic kit'.
2013-07-18 15:01:54	s5fs	nexxy: what more would we need to build your color-sensor on the basic kit?
2013-07-18 15:27:46	nexxy	just the ultrasonic sensor
2013-07-18 15:27:48	nexxy	s5fs,

2013-07-19 13:36:24	 *	Wraithan talks to himself for a while
2013-07-19 13:37:01	adamdicarlo	Rotary encoder?
2013-07-19 13:37:24	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: dial thing you can spin infinitely in either direction
2013-07-19 13:37:33	Wraithan	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10982
2013-07-19 13:37:35	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: ^
2013-07-19 13:38:01	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, thanks. interesting.
2013-07-19 13:38:10	adamdicarlo	so the outputs are relative, I'd take it?
2013-07-19 13:38:21	Wraithan	relative to what?
2013-07-19 13:38:42	adamdicarlo	just my way of thinking about it."outputs gray code so you can tell how much and in which direction it has turned"
2013-07-19 13:38:49	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: one output for one direction, one output for the other direction
2013-07-19 13:38:56	adamdicarlo	ah.
2013-07-19 13:39:16	adamdicarlo	am I going to have any idea how to do anything at nodebotsday?
2013-07-19 13:39:28	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: I don't have any clue as to what I am doing
2013-07-19 13:39:43	Wraithan	hardware hacking is something I've never really done
2013-07-19 13:39:55	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: that rotary encoder is actually quadrature
2013-07-19 13:40:05	adamdicarlo	same here...
2013-07-19 13:40:26	Wraithan	not grey code
2013-07-19 13:40:53	Wraithan	They emit a pattern that you can use to debounce and see how much it moved
2013-07-19 13:41:18	adamdicarlo	okay
2013-07-19 13:41:23	adamdicarlo	i was going off the sparkfun description though
2013-07-19 13:41:31	Wraithan	yea
2013-07-19 13:41:44	Wraithan	the comments clairify a bit because the description isn't quite right
2013-07-19 13:41:45	adamdicarlo	but i see correction in comments. interesting
2013-07-19 13:42:21	adamdicarlo	ah okay. quadrature makes sense. interesting.
2013-07-19 15:46:52	hackygolucky_	thoward: suggestions on type of food/drinks to grab from costco? also, quantities you normally allot per partcipant?
2013-07-19 15:49:26	s5fs	hackygolucky_: bottled water for sure, don't screw us by only getting coconut water and such ;-)
2013-07-19 15:51:18	hackygolucky_	erp. No prob bob.
2013-07-19 15:51:27	hackygolucky_	water is a good thing.
2013-07-19 15:51:48	s5fs	hackygolucky_: thanks :) lack of water nearly killed me at nodeconf haha!
2013-07-19 15:52:50	hackygolucky_	oh no kidding. It was WAY easier to find beer. Which is not ideal for people aren't drinking it.
2013-07-19 15:53:02	hackygolucky_	I wasn't planning on purchasing alcohol. Is that okay?
2013-07-19 15:53:54	s5fs	yeah, i'd pass on beer for a one-day event.
2013-07-19 15:58:52	s5fs	as for snacks, i'd aim for some easy to eat foods, stuff that doesn't make a mess. those chocolate muffins, for example, are super messy.
2013-07-19 16:03:08	hackygolucky_	hah
2013-07-19 16:03:12	hackygolucky_	but... chocolate muffins!
2013-07-19 16:03:18	hackygolucky_	makes sense.
2013-07-19 16:05:03	JSON_voorhees	hackygolucky_: we get hardware ordered yet?
2013-07-19 16:05:21	JSON_voorhees	don't wanna nag, just eager to let my roommate know about the PA deal
2013-07-19 16:05:39	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: I believe so. I need to confirm the total though.
2013-07-19 16:05:57	hackygolucky_	s5fs: did you help get the order in?
2013-07-19 16:07:05	JSON_voorhees	niiice
2013-07-19 16:08:17	hackygolucky_	oh shit. JSON_voorhees I think we may already have a PA setup from UA.
2013-07-19 16:08:20	hackygolucky_	Just thought about that.
2013-07-19 16:11:53	s5fs	hackygolucky_: beats me
2013-07-19 16:12:49	s5fs	hackygolucky_: haha, i can't say i recall you swearing much, too funny. i have sailor-mouth as you know.

2013-07-19 16:19:03	hackygolucky_	but I also say ridiculous things like 'fudge' and 'grumpapatomus'
2013-07-19 16:19:49	s5fs	hackygolucky_: okay, either you're a profanity amateur or i am totally desensitized
2013-07-19 16:20:34	hackygolucky_	hah!
2013-07-19 16:21:16	hackygolucky_	Oh I sometimes feel very un-lady-like in how much I swear.
2013-07-19 16:21:32	s5fs	you have to meet my lady, she makes mechanics blush. she shocks me on occasion!
2013-07-19 16:22:09	nexxy	LOL
2013-07-19 16:22:11	nexxy	I like her.
2013-07-19 16:22:17	s5fs	everyone likes her
2013-07-19 16:24:34	hackygolucky_	:D
2013-07-19 16:24:56	hackygolucky_	when I swear it sounds really mean. Other people sound funny.
2013-07-19 16:26:10	nexxy	meanie

2013-07-21 19:12:37	thoward	it worked
2013-07-21 19:12:43	thoward	i'm going to make a better one though
2013-07-21 19:13:05	thoward	that one i did with the vinyl sheet method, which kind of sucks because the adhesive on the vinyl isn't that strong.
2013-07-21 19:13:07	hackygolucky_	wondering when we need to have our soldering party...
2013-07-21 19:13:21	thoward	next one will be a proper photo emulsion
2013-07-21 19:14:06	thoward	not sure about solder party.. the gear will be arriving in waves.
2013-07-21 19:14:20	thoward	i'd schedule it for as late as possible.. pershaps thursday or friday night?
2013-07-21 19:16:43	hackygolucky_	I can't do Friday night. That's my housewarming party.
2013-07-21 19:16:50	hackygolucky_	Which you guys are invited to, of course.
2013-07-21 19:18:47	thoward	hackygolucky_: duh. forgot about that -- ok, let's say thursday and hope we have enough of the gear in hand by then. actually. if we don't have it in hand by then.. well that's scary anyway
2013-07-21 19:19:39	hackygolucky_	sounds good. We COULD have the soldering fun at my house... it'll be Last Thursday and the neighborhood will be hoppin' anyway. Chill on the front or back porch and burn shit.
2013-07-21 19:25:04	thoward	hackygolucky_: sounds good to me. bonfire?
2013-07-21 19:25:18	thoward	well, small, managed, well contained firepit.
2013-07-21 19:26:31	nexxy	so
2013-07-21 19:26:40	nexxy	what is it that we need to solder at this point?
2013-07-21 19:26:58	nexxy	the only things I can think of would be the robot body stuff
2013-07-21 19:28:34	thoward	nexxy: no freaking idea. i a n00b
2013-07-21 19:28:52	hackygolucky_	thoward: we will have a small firepit
2013-07-21 19:28:57	nexxy	so my uess is unless there are a lot of robot parts to solder
2013-07-21 19:29:03	nexxy	there won't be need for an assembly/soldering party
2013-07-21 19:29:10	nexxy	guess*
2013-07-21 19:30:18	thoward	nexxy: good point
2013-07-21 19:30:56	thoward	but things! solder! you know. robot.
2013-07-21 19:31:16	thoward	we can at least turn on the soldering iron, drink beer and look at all our cool stuff. :)
2013-07-21 19:33:28	thoward	nexxy: still in town on thu night?
2013-07-21 19:33:38	nexxy	not sure yet
2013-07-21 19:33:43	nexxy	trying to figure out my actual itinerary
2013-07-21 19:33:57	nexxy	probably leaving mid-late on 26th

2013-07-22 13:46:01	scottjab	I did start on it, and played a bit more with it last night before I passed out
2013-07-22 14:12:24	s5fs	scottjab: where are you in the process?
2013-07-22 14:12:53	scottjab	mirroring the database, then I fell asleep

2013-07-22 14:14:55	s5fs	scottjab: ah cool, sounds like you're moving in the right direction. i got stuck on couchdb last time, wrong version etc haha
2013-07-22 14:15:13	scottjab	oh I got past that, I got to schema replication
2013-07-22 14:15:23	scottjab	I should have some time late tonight and tomorrow to work on it more

2013-07-22 14:16:40	scottjab	I don't think I need luck, I need whiskey
2013-07-22 14:19:51	s5fs	scottjab: i think a decent 90 proof bourbon pairs well with database replication
2013-07-22 14:19:59	scottjab	it does!
2013-07-22 14:20:16	s5fs	for smaller datasets i usually just rock an 80 proof with a mixer of some sort, nothing crazy
2013-07-22 14:20:36	scottjab	what about bigdata?
2013-07-22 14:21:09	s5fs	moderate drinking, but make sure you have snacks on hand in case it takes a while
2013-07-22 14:21:44	scottjab	I try to kick the keg before Cassandra is done replicating

2013-07-22 14:46:39	chrisdickinson	thanks!
2013-07-22 14:47:03	randallagordon	Happened to remember there was an excellent breadboard internal wiring graphic
2013-07-22 14:49:13	randallagordon	And for folks wrangling J5 in Windows, give 0.10.8 a shot if you encounter...ghosts... I've had various issues with both J5 and node-midi using 0.10.13
2013-07-22 14:51:56	dlmanning	That's discouraging
2013-07-22 14:52:42	randallagordon	I've yet to attempt to track down what's up. Basically decided getting to work on something functional was more fun than debugging something that wasn't ;)
2013-07-22 14:53:56	randallagordon	versions in between may be fine, too, I just jumped to 0.10.8 because it also solved some node-midi issues I was having with my Ubuntu VM
2013-07-22 14:54:00	dlmanning	means we might conceivably need to have instructions ready on how to roll back your node installation

2013-07-22 14:57:31	randallagordon	Intermittent connection problems for the most part board would have about a 50/50 shot of connecting on any given run
2013-07-22 14:58:28	dlmanning	lovely
2013-07-22 14:58:40	randallagordon	...there's also a chance it might be my 'duino. I'm running an older version of Firmata that I tweaked to enable pullup resistors and I've yet to rule that out
2013-07-22 15:01:05	dlmanning	Well, thanks for the heads up, in any event
2013-07-22 15:02:17	s5fs	randallagordon: is there a node version manager for windows?
2013-07-22 15:02:41	randallagordon	Not that I'm aware of :/
2013-07-22 15:02:53	randallagordon	Good ol' Uninstall/reinstall
2013-07-22 15:03:06	s5fs	ugh, windows
2013-07-22 15:03:29	randallagordon	I think you can install it via Chocolatey...does that support specific versions perhaps?
2013-07-22 15:03:34	 *	randallagordon hits the Googles...
2013-07-22 15:04:16	s5fs	randallagordon: does chocolately manage your path too, or just wrap nuget?
2013-07-22 15:04:16	randallagordon	BOOM! `cinst nodejs.install -Version 0.10.08`
2013-07-22 15:04:36	randallagordon	Of course, then you've gotta involve installing Chocolatey...
2013-07-22 15:05:01	s5fs	i only know nuget via VS, is it a stand-alone install somewhere?
2013-07-22 15:05:08	s5fs	i assume most are just installing node from msi or whatever
2013-07-22 15:07:39	randallagordon	chocolatey just snags the msi and does a quiet install
2013-07-22 15:08:36	s5fs	right, so it's not managing the path, it's probably uninstalling/reinstalling to the correct version
2013-07-22 15:08:59	s5fs	sounds like an opportunity to create a windows version manager (WinNVM)
2013-07-22 15:09:44	randallagordon	There may well be one, I've just never looked. Johnny-Five is the only reason I do anything with Node in Windows at all lol
2013-07-22 15:10:05	s5fs	randallagordon: you a windows guy, i take it?
2013-07-22 15:10:52	randallagordon	Reluctantly
2013-07-22 15:11:51	s5fs	it's crazy, i have a solid windows background (nt4-win7) but my interest has been eroding steadily since server 2008. i'm now almost completely off the platform professionally.
2013-07-22 15:12:34	randallagordon	Some of the music stuff I tinker with forces me to keep Windows as a host
2013-07-22 15:13:18	randallagordon	Otherwise I'd probably just be running Ubuntu on everything
2013-07-22 15:14:33	Wraithan	windows on my gaming PC
2013-07-22 15:14:37	Wraithan	osx on my laptops
2013-07-22 15:14:41	Wraithan	linux on my servers
2013-07-22 15:14:48	Wraithan	iOS tablet

2013-07-22 15:15:07	Wraithan	kindle for my ereader
2013-07-22 15:15:20	randallagordon	That looks like it may be worth giving a shot
2013-07-22 15:16:28	randallagordon	scratch that, this claims to improve upon nvmw: https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist
2013-07-22 15:17:00	 *	randallagordon cowers in fear at `nodist + all`
2013-07-22 15:17:12	Wraithan	I like to follow path of "this is a better version of X" then go back one level and call it good
2013-07-22 15:20:06	randallagordon	Might be a safer bet ;)
2013-07-22 15:20:29	randallagordon	They both look to be fairly faithful recreations of their non-Windows counterparts in nvm and n

2013-07-23 09:49:58	hackygolucky_	so hopefully I'm preparing everyone for my nag-o-meter kicking in.
2013-07-23 10:00:06	dlmanning	a bouncer?
2013-07-23 10:01:36	hackygolucky_	irc bouncer
2013-07-23 10:01:52	hackygolucky_	so they would see my message even if they weren't currently active on irc.

2013-07-23 13:09:33	hackygolucky_	I DID get the NodeBots stickers in the mail last night. <3 SO MUCH.

2013-07-23 13:17:56	scottjab	oh hey, so I think I have a ghettoed mirror of npm in a VM
2013-07-23 13:18:00	scottjab	cc s5fs
2013-07-23 13:18:32	Wraithan	doesn't substack do this all the time, have we tried pinging him to see if he has any tips?

2013-07-23 13:18:58	hackygolucky_	emilyrose: ah, we're gonna have so many awesome stickers. Kinda love it!
2013-07-23 13:19:41	hackygolucky_	I'll be sending out an email tomorrow to participants with installfest prep(just in case) and to let them know about bringing something to screenprint on. Because thoward is awesome.
2013-07-23 13:21:27	hackygolucky_	emilyrose: are you bringing all your hardware-y goodness of projects down to SF?
2013-07-23 13:26:02	chrisdickinson	scottjab: how are you testing it?

2013-07-23 13:26:44	scottjab	it isn't quite done mirroring, but what has been mirroed works

2013-07-23 13:27:13	scottjab	I will write some quick and dirty puppet modules tonight

2013-07-23 13:29:00	scottjab	wut
2013-07-23 13:52:54	thoward	hardware keeps rolling in!
2013-07-23 13:53:21	thoward	got all the arduinos, breadboards, jumpers, some sensors, pots, etc.
2013-07-23 13:53:27	scottjab	rad!
2013-07-23 13:53:56	thoward	there's a lot of packages showing up on my doorstep past couple days. i gotta say, i don't understand amazon's delivery system.
2013-07-23 13:54:36	hackygolucky_	yeah I don't either. And it is still so wasteful...
2013-07-23 13:54:40	thoward	probably got a few bits here a few bits there, but i'll get like a whole 8x10x4 box with like one little thing in.
2013-07-23 13:55:17	thoward	so far i've gotten 8 boxes, and it all fits into two
2013-07-23 13:55:25	chrisdickinson	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem
2013-07-23 13:55:54	dlmanning	box sizes are determined by the necessity of creating stable pallet loads in trucks
2013-07-23 13:56:21	thoward	haha, fine, i'm sure there's a bunch of reasons for it, but it's bewildering.
2013-07-23 14:01:40	scottjab	JSON_voorheez: ping
2013-07-23 14:05:44	Wraithan	Also there is the padding thing, people get all up in arms about chip companies, but that air is there for two reasons: 1) So you don't end up with a bag of crumbs 2) contents settle during shipping
2013-07-23 14:06:44	thoward	Wraithan: true that. i'm happy that amazon, through whatever level of efficiency, got our stuff here in one piece, on time, and for free (amazon prime trials, booyah!)
2013-07-23 14:07:33	 *	thoward feels like the positive python attitude needs to spill over into more channels.
2013-07-23 14:09:23	thoward	for fun, here's a sneak peek at the new cascadiajs website/logo design: http://stage.steamclock.com/cjs2013/
2013-07-23 14:09:33	thoward	we're iterating on design right now. opinions?
2013-07-23 14:19:55	dlmanning	thoward: one more color?
2013-07-23 14:20:14	thoward	yeah, like brown?
2013-07-23 14:20:31	dlmanning	burnt butterscotch
2013-07-23 14:21:08	Wraithan	thoward: that green is a bit harsh on my eyes
2013-07-23 14:21:23	thoward	i find the whole thing a bit too bright, personally.
2013-07-23 14:21:29	Wraithan	yea
2013-07-23 14:24:28	hackygolucky_	thoward: I think I like the colors thus far but agree that another color is needed. The white with the bright colors seems a bit too light.
2013-07-23 14:38:28	JSON_voorheez	scottjab: any luck with the npm repo?
2013-07-23 14:38:34	scottjab	read up ;-)
2013-07-23 14:38:47	scottjab	I need hardware, but I got a vm mirroring and workingish
2013-07-23 14:38:55	Wraithan	scottjab: how much hardware?
2013-07-23 14:39:07	scottjab	60ish gigs of space
2013-07-23 14:39:08	scottjab	http://www.idimmu.net/2013/06/20/how-to-create-an-npm-repository-mirror/
2013-07-23 14:39:09	JSON_voorheez	great, I can get you that mac mini tonight
2013-07-23 14:39:11	Wraithan	oh
2013-07-23 14:39:11	scottjab	I jsut followed that
2013-07-23 14:39:21	Wraithan	that is tiny
2013-07-23 14:39:39	Wraithan	scottjab: I can provide that in a usb enclosure or just the drive, whichever you want
2013-07-23 14:40:01	Wraithan	have a 1tb drive doing basically nothing right now
2013-07-23 14:43:20	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_: I still need a hardware list for the zine
2013-07-23 14:43:47	Wraithan	I wonder if my sparkfun hardware will arrive at my house soon
2013-07-23 14:43:55	JSON_voorheez	scottjab: let me know whether or not you want to use that minimac
2013-07-23 14:44:22	Wraithan	oh look at that: https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?tracknumbers=236132115316288&cntry_code=us
2013-07-23 14:44:37	Wraithan	it arrived at my house after I left for work this morning
2013-07-23 14:45:27	scottjab	JSON_voorheez: can I wipe it and throw linux on it
2013-07-23 14:45:32	scottjab	it looks like couch sucks on OS X
2013-07-23 14:45:33	JSON_voorheez	sure thing
2013-07-23 14:45:48	JSON_voorheez	yeah I was planning on running linux in a vm but wiping it is fine too
2013-07-23 14:45:50	scottjab	I don't know how late I will be at UA today
2013-07-23 14:45:54	scottjab	ether way
2013-07-23 14:46:30	JSON_voorheez	we also wanna use it as a file server for tutorial files, etc...
2013-07-23 14:46:52	scottjab	yeah I can throw it in a VM
2013-07-23 14:46:54	scottjab	that will be asier
2013-07-23 14:46:56	scottjab	easier
2013-07-23 14:47:00	JSON_voorheez	awesome.
2013-07-23 14:47:36	JSON_voorheez	wanna just send me a text when you wanna meet up for it? 434.944.1440.

2013-07-23 14:53:22	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: do you mean what we are providing hardware-wise?
2013-07-23 14:53:54	hackygolucky_	if so, I think s5fs has the list. I actually need it as well for the email I'm sending out tomorrow.
2013-07-23 14:56:02	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_: Yeah, s5fs I'm going to need that as soon as possible. I don't want to be doing everything friday night.
2013-07-23 14:57:38	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: absolutely. I'll try and get a hold of Adam this evening. I should have asked for that list sooner.

2013-07-23 15:07:13	JSON_voorheez	sound good :)
2013-07-23 15:17:08	emilyrose	hackygolucky_, JSON_voorheez hardware list?
2013-07-23 15:17:41	emilyrose	software requirements = 0.10.x (preferably 0.10.13) and johnny-five installed in a project directory
2013-07-23 15:19:37	hackygolucky_	emilyrose: I think we were just talking about listing out what we're providing in the kits...
2013-07-23 15:19:54	emilyrose	oh
2013-07-23 15:20:00	emilyrose	do we need a hard count? or a general idea?
2013-07-23 15:20:22	thoward	yeah, now that i've got some of the gear here, i'd like to start assembling the kits from the various parts.
2013-07-23 15:20:46	thoward	obviously, arduino, breadboard, jumpers (count per kit?)
2013-07-23 15:20:55	emilyrose	arduino uno R3, buttons, photoresistors, LEDs, potentiometers, and all the jumpers, resistors, etc you need for that
2013-07-23 15:21:45	emilyrose	s5fs, and I planned on having kits assembled with a modest amount of components
2013-07-23 15:21:55	emilyrose	so we have extra on-hand
2013-07-23 15:22:17	emilyrose	I think he has the notebook with the list of the actual count for everything
2013-07-23 15:22:20	Wraithan	Oh I should get a potentiometer. I have no idea what my potential is.
2013-07-23 15:22:26	emilyrose	Wraithan, lol
2013-07-23 15:22:37	Wraithan	Teachers always said I have a lot of it though
2013-07-23 15:22:46	Wraithan	and that I am not living up to it
2013-07-23 15:22:48	Wraithan	...
2013-07-23 15:22:48	hackygolucky_	emilyrose: if you guys need help bagging, let me know :)
2013-07-23 15:23:28	emilyrose	if it happens before friday I can help!
2013-07-23 15:25:38	thoward	if only it was that easy to measure input/output
2013-07-23 15:26:13	thoward	Wraithan: i need the same thing for calories. this whole "assume what you've burned, guestimate your input from FDA standards and eye ball measurements".
2013-07-23 15:26:16	thoward	ugh
2013-07-23 15:26:59	thoward	in other news, i've upgraded my terminal experience dramatically. i'm now using terminology with fish. wow, modern world, here we come.
2013-07-23 15:27:00	Wraithan	So I don't want to seem like a dolt, but what happens to the kits at the end of the event? we planning on giving them away in some rewarding and/or random way
2013-07-23 15:27:16	thoward	Wraithan: good question. i have no idea.
2013-07-23 15:27:20	hackygolucky_	So.
2013-07-23 15:27:23	thoward	we don't have enough to give one to everyone.
2013-07-23 15:27:24	Wraithan	So.
2013-07-23 15:27:28	hackygolucky_	This is something we still needed to talk about.
2013-07-23 15:27:37	thoward	we could jut hang on to all/most of them for future events.
2013-07-23 15:27:38	Wraithan	Oh.
2013-07-23 15:27:42	hackygolucky_	I had thought, like NodeConf, we as organizers identify people who are SUPER excited
2013-07-23 15:27:45	hackygolucky_	(a few)
2013-07-23 15:27:53	hackygolucky_	and make sure they walk with one.
2013-07-23 15:28:16	emilyrose	PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uUlOAyQsn4
2013-07-23 15:28:18	hackygolucky_	Otherwise, being able to hold onto these kits for future events would be AMAZING.
2013-07-23 15:29:01	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson and I had talked about storing them here at UA because it is a sponsor and a decent location and we have 24 hour access.
2013-07-23 15:29:03	hackygolucky_	BUT
2013-07-23 15:29:08	hackygolucky_	input is welcome.
2013-07-23 15:29:16	hackygolucky_	It does not have to be that way.
2013-07-23 15:29:16	thoward	hackygolucky_: agreed. only prob with that is that it's a bit arbitrary who gets to keep a kit.
2013-07-23 15:29:43	thoward	which might rub some folks the wrong way if they notice and disagree with our opinions.
2013-07-23 15:29:49	hackygolucky_	thoward: right. Alternatively it could be a prize for a challenge? But that's difficult for newbs.
2013-07-23 15:33:23	thoward	yeah, it could also just be completely random.
2013-07-23 15:33:35	thoward	like, draw a name out of a hat
2013-07-23 15:33:43	thoward	but i like rewarding enthusiasm
2013-07-23 15:35:11	thoward	that resonates w/ me, considering a similar gift is what let me, a poor poor boy in one of the worst ghettos of st. louis, get a computer at age 7 and start what would become a life-long relationship to this art of hacking. without someone rewarding my enthusiasm with a simple gift, i'd probably be selling drugs, or dead, or a starving painter/writer/musician.
2013-07-23 15:35:44	thoward	we might not be doing anything that dramatic for anyone, but the methodology is sound.
2013-07-23 15:36:18	hackygolucky_	so...
2013-07-23 15:36:21	hackygolucky_	:)
2013-07-23 15:36:52	hackygolucky_	enthusiasm prize?
2013-07-23 15:36:54	JSON_voorheez	so looking forward to the point when I no longer want a cigarette
2013-07-23 15:41:01	hackygolucky_	emilyrose: have you given out kits in past hackdays?
2013-07-23 15:41:08	thoward	JSON_voorheez: it happens. i used to smoke 2 packs a day. now i could give a shit less.
2013-07-23 15:41:35	thoward	hackygolucky_: yup enthusiasm prize, ftw!
2013-07-23 15:42:21	hackygolucky_	cool.
2013-07-23 15:47:07	emilyrose	hackygolucky_, I've given out kits at conferences
2013-07-23 15:47:31	emilyrose	hackygolucky_, and I believe a few people may have been gifted with some things @ last year's version of nodebotsday
2013-07-23 15:47:39	emilyrose	hackygolucky_, basically same criteria
2013-07-23 15:47:49	emilyrose	"you are really into this stuff"
2013-07-23 15:47:50	hackygolucky_	cool.
2013-07-23 15:48:05	emilyrose	when I give stuff out personally
2013-07-23 15:48:15	emilyrose	I just ask them to pay it forward when/if they keep going
2013-07-23 15:48:30	hackygolucky_	awesome. Good call.

2013-07-24 12:27:24	hackygolucky_	s/ahnks/thanks
2013-07-24 12:59:47	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_: we have a hardware list yet?
2013-07-24 13:00:20	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: you need a bouncer :P
2013-07-24 13:00:45	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorheez: you got a server running anyplace?
2013-07-24 13:00:54	hackygolucky_	it's on the README for simple-color-sensor www.github.com/nexxy/simple-color-sensor
2013-07-24 13:01:08	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: ^^
2013-07-24 13:01:33	hackygolucky_	I also should be posting this info elsewhere. So that's my bad.
2013-07-24 13:01:37	chrisdickinson	(if so -- and if you've got it running ubuntu, running a bouncer is as easy as `aptitude install znc; znc --makeconf; znc znc.conf`)
2013-07-24 13:05:11	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_ chrisdickinson definitely need to set one up!
2013-07-24 13:05:15	JSON_voorheez	sry guisee
2013-07-24 13:05:29	hackygolucky_	I do too.
2013-07-24 13:05:36	hackygolucky_	 I haven't yet. Just use irccloud
2013-07-24 13:05:44	hackygolucky_	which is the pits.
2013-07-24 13:06:11	JSON_voorheez	thanks! I'm gunna try and knock out the zine tonight then maybe chrisdickinson will want to meet up tomorrow night before I get them printed?
2013-07-24 13:06:32	chrisdickinson	yes, +1
2013-07-24 13:06:36	JSON_voorheez	yay!
2013-07-24 13:09:11	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: so did scottjab already get the mac mini from you?
2013-07-24 13:09:15	hackygolucky_	(for the private npm)
2013-07-24 13:09:24	scottjab	I didn't have time last night
2013-07-24 13:09:46	scottjab	I am not in the office today, so It will be a little harder
2013-07-24 13:10:02	chrisdickinson	oh man, $35 for ec2 micro for 3 years. perfect for irc bouncers.
2013-07-24 13:10:11	hackygolucky_	whoa. Nice!
2013-07-24 13:10:39	scottjab	yeah, that is how I do it chrisdickinson
2013-07-24 13:10:55	JSON_voorheez	chrisdickinson: sounds like a deal
2013-07-24 13:10:59	chrisdickinson	i need to decommission my slicehost server
2013-07-24 13:11:04	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: could you bring the mac mini to work tomorrow and justinabrahms could bring it home?
2013-07-24 13:11:05	JSON_voorheez	scottjab: if you'd like I can meet you somewhere tonight
2013-07-24 13:11:17	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_: scottjab that works as well :)
2013-07-24 13:11:27	scottjab	that is easier
2013-07-24 13:11:42	JSON_voorheez	scottjab: thanks again for getting that working
2013-07-24 13:11:52	hackygolucky_	scottjab: that would just mean you won't have the mini until Friday unless I have time Thursday night to deliver it. Is that okay?
2013-07-24 13:11:52	JSON_voorheez	did you make a recipe for it?
2013-07-24 13:11:56	scottjab	sure, I ops
2013-07-24 13:12:19	scottjab	hackygolucky_: yeah it should be fine, I will just have it mirror over night at UA
2013-07-24 13:12:24	scottjab	faster internets
2013-07-24 13:12:34	hackygolucky_	cool.
2013-07-24 13:12:34	JSON_voorheez	awesome, you should think about putting it up on gh, lots of people would be into that
2013-07-24 13:12:46	hackygolucky_	also, getting donuts and coffee for Saturday morning. It will be glorious.

2013-07-24 13:13:32	JSON_voorheez	hackygolucky_: are we still planning for all the organizers to run through the beginners track before saturday?
2013-07-24 13:14:10	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: it would be VERY useful for us to do that, yes.
2013-07-24 13:14:46	hackygolucky_	s5fs emilyrose are you all available Thursday evening to mess around with hardware at my house? I know it is crunch time...

2013-07-24 17:55:20	adamdicarlo	xobbob, they've been buying up hardware for the event... so if your question is "do i have to bring this stuff", nope, I don't think so
2013-07-24 17:56:13	xobbob	Cool. So, it's stuff we use while we're there so we don't all have to bring our own?
