2014-01-16 16:20:19	coddingtonbear	really, really tempted to re-live my childhood and install the new FFVI :-|
2014-01-16 16:20:41	coddingtonbear	so many projects that I should be working on instead -- will I be as disappointed as I'm seeing people say they are on twitter, bitprophet ?
2014-01-16 16:21:36	Wraithan	coddingtonbear: the eternal conflict for me
2014-01-16 16:21:41	Wraithan	video games and coding
2014-01-16 16:22:07	 *	schmichael chuckles a little just thinking about void* destroyer
2014-01-16 16:22:14	coddingtonbear	I've been really good about not getting into gaming...until the last year or so
2014-01-16 16:22:28	maaaaaaaaaarc	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r2-fTk3PNs
2014-01-16 16:22:30	Wraithan	coddingtonbear: see, I view it as time to recharge
2014-01-16 16:22:48	rickbmartin_	so that's why coddingtonbear has looked so ragged in the last year   :-)
2014-01-16 16:23:13	Wraithan	spend a couple weeks gaming to distance myself from my projects, then come back to them and have better ideas of how they should be built
2014-01-16 16:25:05	rickbmartin_	Wraithan, that would not work for me.  I just crash and burn at the end.
2014-01-16 16:25:54	coddingtonbear	Hrm; for a long time I really did my best to stay away from anything non-productive
2014-01-16 16:26:11	Wraithan	coddingtonbear: I stress out a lot when I do that
2014-01-16 16:26:21	ericholscher	cant be productive all the time
2014-01-16 16:26:32	coddingtonbear	during college, discovering a fun game could've been disasterous with how packed time was
2014-01-16 16:26:34	ericholscher	or, maybe you can, but you just need to redefine productive :)
2014-01-16 16:27:14	Wraithan	When playing SC2 was part of being productive, I procrastinated by writing software
2014-01-16 16:27:16	Wraithan	<.<
2014-01-16 16:28:00	maaaaaaaaaarc	procrastination is an important part of life
2014-01-16 16:28:36	Wraithan	When I'm at home and feeling super procrastination-y I clean the house
2014-01-16 16:28:46	Wraithan	other than my office
2014-01-16 16:28:56	Wraithan	because that is where the thing I am avoiding is
2014-01-16 16:29:00	Wraithan	so my office is a mess
2014-01-16 16:29:41	kdj	Cleaning being a procrastination activity is a pretty good default
2014-01-16 16:30:21	coddingtonbear	my s/o used to joke that he could tell when I had a paper due because I had rearranged the furniture of my bedroom
2014-01-16 16:30:53	coddingtonbear	there are lots of ways of procrastinating -- not all of them are zero-value
2014-01-16 16:31:03	Wraithan	right
2014-01-16 16:31:26	ericholscher	i've always liked reading > video games
2014-01-16 16:31:32	coddingtonbear	& I'm a little hesitant to describe playing games as having any real value :-\
2014-01-16 16:31:58	Wraithan	coddingtonbear: there is social value, depending on the game
2014-01-16 16:32:17	Wraithan	coddingtonbear: for a while I was aiming to play sc2 at a moderately competitive level, so that was value to me
2014-01-16 16:33:02	coddingtonbear	definitely; there are definitely aspects from which gaming isn't a total waste of time
2014-01-16 16:33:30	coddingtonbear	+1 ericholscher
2014-01-16 16:33:34	Wraithan	I go to lan parties on most mondays
2014-01-16 16:34:02	ericholscher	i want to be a better writer more than I want to be a better...video gamer -- so reading has more value to me in that regard
2014-01-16 16:34:06	Wraithan	even though I don't care for the game we play that much it is super fun to hang out with my friends and work together to destroy the enemy
2014-01-16 16:34:10	ericholscher	but yea, reading is not the most social thing :)
2014-01-16 16:34:17	Wraithan	ericholscher: book club!
2014-01-16 16:34:28	ericholscher	i've never been good at book clubs
2014-01-16 16:34:41	ericholscher	i imagine its all about who's in it
2014-01-16 16:34:42	coddingtonbear	aww, I've got a couple of friends who do one
2014-01-16 16:34:57	maaaaaaaaaarc	the important thing is not to be uptight about them, imho
2014-01-16 16:35:06	Wraithan	also, old versions of D&D they were more reading than they were gaming
2014-01-16 16:35:07	maaaaaaaaaarc	if I wanted homework I'd still be in school
2014-01-16 16:35:16	@gmcquillan	maaaaaaaaaarc: yeah!
