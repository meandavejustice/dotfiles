2013-07-26 14:43:07	scottjab	npm is a shit show btw
2013-07-26 14:43:18	scottjab	the backend needs some work

2013-07-26 14:43:25	JSON_voorheez	yay!
2013-07-26 14:44:24	JSON_voorheez	scottjab: do you have an address for the local file server so i can put it in this booklet?
2013-07-26 14:44:33	scottjab	I wont until tomorrow
2013-07-26 14:44:35	JSON_voorheez	(where we are going to store the html files and such)
2013-07-26 14:44:38	JSON_voorheez	ahh okay
2013-07-26 14:44:46	s5fs	JSON_voorheez: maybe just leave a place to write it in?
2013-07-26 14:44:54	JSON_voorheez	yeah I can do that
2013-07-26 14:45:20	s5fs	JSON_voorheez: super pumped to see what you've come up with!!
2013-07-26 14:45:26	JSON_voorheez	also simple-color-sensor is not on npm yet.. are we just gunna put that on the server or have people clone it
2013-07-26 14:45:35	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: me too :)
2013-07-26 14:45:54	JSON_voorheez	haha It's coming along just need a couple more resources..
2013-07-26 14:46:14	JSON_voorheez	also were gunna have to rework simple-color-sensor to work with 6 separate leds..
2013-07-26 14:48:03	JSON_voorheez	I'm probably just gunna fork it, re work it, and publish to npm?
2013-07-26 14:53:00	s5fs	UGH
2013-07-26 14:53:49	JSON_voorheez	Yeah..

2013-07-26 15:43:30	hackygolucky_	s5fs: only problem is that we have 35 kits with other lights, so it would be helpful to have the new instructions as well, though not absolutely necessary
2013-07-26 15:57:48	s5fs	hackygolucky_: I don't expect everyone to want to do the color-sensor project
2013-07-26 15:58:12	s5fs	we've got enough gear that folks should be able to just play with stuff using the J5 docs
2013-07-26 15:58:31	s5fs	those who are totally down for the color sensor, we can either give them a sparkfun kit or just shuffle the tri-color leds around
2013-07-26 15:58:56	s5fs	If anyone is in beaverton, they could prob hit Norvac and pick up LEDs as well, they're stupid expensive at ratshack
2013-07-26 16:00:13	adamdicarlo	nice, i've never heard "ratshack" before. "shitshack" is what my dad would say
2013-07-26 16:00:49	adamdicarlo	s5fs, "Yelpers report [norvac electronics inc] has closed"
2013-07-26 16:00:53	adamdicarlo	http://www.yelp.com/biz/norvac-electronics-inc-beaverton
2013-07-26 16:02:27	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: I think thats a swell plan :)
2013-07-26 16:02:45	s5fs	adamdicarlo: well crap
2013-07-26 16:02:52	s5fs	the next place I can think of would be fry's
2013-07-26 16:02:59	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: is there a step by step document for the simple-color-thing?? 
2013-07-26 16:03:02	adamdicarlo	s5fs, first review says there's a "replacement"
2013-07-26 16:03:24	JSON_voorheez	its probably already been posted a dozen times in here, but I'm bad with statying connected
2013-07-26 16:03:51	adamdicarlo	here we go: http://www.yelp.com/biz/oregon-electronics-beaverton < s5fs
2013-07-26 16:04:03	adamdicarlo	fry's is far
2013-07-26 16:04:11	adamdicarlo	oregon-electronics is only open til 5pm today
2013-07-26 16:05:05	s5fs	anyone close by?
2013-07-26 16:05:36	s5fs	JSON_voorheez: no, not that I'm aware of. just connect the wires as the illustration shows, then run the code. "works for me"
2013-07-26 16:06:18	s5fs	hackygolucky_: how critical do you consider the LEDs? do I need to make a run?
2013-07-26 16:08:20	hackygolucky_	No, we talked it out last night and thought the multiple lights would be fine
2013-07-26 16:09:23	hackygolucky_	Really not a huge concern
2013-07-26 16:09:26	JSON_voorheez	s5fs: so the issue is that i have to rework it with 6 leds
2013-07-26 16:09:48	JSON_voorheez	but I'd like to do it with the OG one if possible
2013-07-26 16:10:28	JSON_voorheez	i just dont have one of those multi leds
2013-07-26 16:11:12	JSON_voorheez	but i'd really like to get a step by step document up
2013-07-26 16:11:17	JSON_voorheez	for the uber newbiez
2013-07-26 16:11:38	JSON_voorheez	and for the zine, since that was the main point of it
2013-07-26 16:11:55	hackygolucky_	Yeah I thought we would have that too. If I had known sooner I would have done it myself
2013-07-26 16:15:18	hackygolucky_	Right. Who was responsible for the content? Was that everyone?
2013-07-26 16:15:46	hackygolucky_	( I don't have my notes on me)
2013-07-26 16:16:05	JSON_voorheez	just realized there is a radioshack down the street from me, I'm gunna go pick up an rgb led and get this stuff up :)
2013-07-26 16:17:36	hackygolucky_	Sigh. Owe you a drink, JSON_voorheez
2013-07-26 16:19:59	s5fs	hackygolucky_: what documentation is necessary here? there's a simple schematic (connect these components) showing how to configure hte arduino. attendees should just clone the repo, populate their breadboard and then run the code.
2013-07-26 16:20:54	s5fs	JSON_voorheez: uber noobs are going to need in-person hand-holding, we need to identify the quickly and put them in an area where 1-2 people can easily support them
2013-07-26 16:21:15	hackygolucky_	THIS^^
2013-07-26 16:21:19	s5fs	for most others, I expect this is a hackday, not an instructor-lead course, hence the lack of detailed material
2013-07-26 16:21:40	s5fs	hackygolucky_: who's working the door?
2013-07-26 16:22:17	hackygolucky_	Having instructions is helpful. Its like a full blown tutorial instead of squinting at an image and counting breadboard holes
2013-07-26 16:23:02	s5fs	no way to get outta squinting at holes
2013-07-26 16:24:01	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i gtg but I'll be back online this evening, around 7-8p
2013-07-26 16:24:50	hackygolucky_	Cook
2013-07-26 16:26:09	hackygolucky_	Also JSON_voorheez there's a gist with the instructions from when Chris and Adam ran through it
2013-07-26 16:29:21	JSON_voorheez	can i get that link?
2013-07-26 16:29:51	JSON_voorheez	I got three rbg leds(all they had)
2013-07-26 16:30:06	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorheez: sorry. Almost have it
2013-07-26 16:30:09	JSON_voorheez	sweet
2013-07-26 16:30:13	JSON_voorheez	and the drawings?
2013-07-26 16:30:29	JSON_voorheez	also I feel that having instructions is better than none
2013-07-26 16:30:35	JSON_voorheez	there is no reason not to have them
2013-07-26 16:31:26	chrisdickinson	hackygolucky_: https://gist.github.com/chrisdickinson/cd28448b92ce4f5c6da3
2013-07-26 16:31:29	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorheez: ^^
2013-07-26 16:31:35	chrisdickinson	they're not extensive
2013-07-26 16:31:38	JSON_voorheez	thank YOUz!
2013-07-26 16:31:56	chrisdickinson	also NB: i have run across materials online that stress "don't make hardware changes with the arduino USB hooked in"
2013-07-26 16:31:58	hackygolucky_	YAY!
2013-07-26 16:32:05	chrisdickinson	drawings are in a sketchbook at home
2013-07-26 16:32:11	chrisdickinson	which is the worst
2013-07-26 16:32:17	chrisdickinson	i am the worst
2013-07-26 16:32:21	JSON_voorheez	i'm going through with pics anyays
2013-07-26 16:32:23	chrisdickinson	!dm chrisdickinson
2013-07-26 16:32:24	ZenWraithBot	You're doing horrible work chrisdickinson!
2013-07-26 16:32:29	JSON_voorheez	haha
2013-07-26 16:32:43	JSON_voorheez	chrisdickinson: no biggie, could you bring them to hackygolucky_ 's house tonight?
2013-07-26 16:32:51	JSON_voorheez	I can add them in there :)
2013-07-26 16:32:59	chrisdickinson	sure, i've just got like a page, and some random robot pics
2013-07-26 16:33:04	JSON_voorheez	I'm also gunna put your node conf drawing in there if it fits
2013-07-26 16:33:06	JSON_voorheez	perfect.
2013-07-26 16:33:07	chrisdickinson	it's basically "intro to breadboards
2013-07-26 16:33:10	chrisdickinson	"
2013-07-26 16:33:13	chrisdickinson	awesome

2013-07-26 16:53:47	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: by hardware changes do you mean putting in jumpers and stuff?
2013-07-26 16:53:56	Wraithan	Because I do that all the time with my teensy :/
2013-07-26 17:08:08	JSON_voorheez	chrisdickinson: these breadboards we got are v. tiny, I'm having to rework this from the diagram. just as a heads up for tomorrow
2013-07-26 17:09:07	Wraithan	JSON_voorheez: yeah, they were a little smaller than I expected
2013-07-26 17:09:22	Wraithan	Ended up only being able to build one of my media keyboards instead of 2 like I wanted
2013-07-26 17:12:06	JSON_voorheez	Wraithan: ahh
2013-07-26 17:12:12	JSON_voorheez	I cant wait to see those
2013-07-26 17:12:23	Wraithan	Yeah, I'll be bringing it :)
2013-07-26 17:12:31	JSON_voorheez	woohoo!
2013-07-26 17:24:24	Wraithan	Oh sweet, sparkfun is sending me the right rotary encoders, spare breakouts for the ones that I already soldered and some extra breakaway headers
2013-07-26 17:25:03	Wraithan	They even offered to solder it for me if I wanted.
2013-07-26 17:26:10	Wraithan	I declined since I need the practice
2013-07-26 17:26:19	Wraithan	but it is really great of them to offer
2013-07-26 17:32:28	JSON_voorheez	very cool!
