2014-01-16 13:33:54	meandavejustice	programmatically or just by hitting the back button?
2014-01-16 13:35:47	florapdx	I don't quite understand what you're asking, but right now, if a user navigates to organizer from a permalink page, and then wants to go back to the perma page by hitting the browser's back button, nothing happens
2014-01-16 13:37:32	meandavejustice	that is a bug
2014-01-16 13:38:20	meandavejustice	something must be I would look to see what is happening in the navigate functions in application controller
