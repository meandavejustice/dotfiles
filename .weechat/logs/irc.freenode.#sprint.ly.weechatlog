2013-07-29 16:44:06	justinabrahms	It should still show. Very little has changed with github in the past few months.
2013-07-29 16:44:14	Yadah	I have been playing around with GH integration today recording a video
2013-07-29 16:44:20	justinabrahms	you may need to deactivate things in github as well as in sprint.ly

2013-07-30 12:47:30	jstump	Yadah_: Regarding that blog post.
2013-07-30 12:47:34	jstump	Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception
2013-07-30 12:48:53	jstump	Combine that with the various lists of cognitive biases and how they intersect and you're basically asking to fuck yourself on time estimates. 
2013-07-30 12:49:16	jstump	Note: "The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time."
2013-07-30 12:49:30	jstump	Our perception of time changes with age as well.
2013-07-30 12:49:40	jstump	And, depending on motion, it can also get fucked up.
2013-07-30 12:49:53	jstump	Basically, humans are fucking idiots when it comes to time estimates. 
2013-07-30 12:50:39	jstump	Even the temperature effects our perception of time: Experiments have suggested that when body temperature is raised, our perception of time speeds up. Conversely, when we are cooled down, our sense of time slows down.
2013-07-30 13:16:22	Yadah_	jstump: When reading this and seeing how many times I have been put under the gun because of my engineers times estimates it makes me want to cry a little for being yelled at something we really had no way of doing correctly

2013-07-30 13:49:26	justinabrahms	jstump: where is our oboe config? Those change nick made to track celery tasks aren't being tracked.
2013-07-30 13:50:07	jstump	Have we restarted celeryd?
2013-07-30 13:50:11	jstump	They're in chef.
2013-07-30 13:50:19	justinabrahms	we restart every evening.
2013-07-30 13:50:51	jstump	Oh, word. 
2013-07-30 13:51:05	jstump	So there's not much configuration involved. 
2013-07-30 13:51:14	jstump	But it's in the tracelytics cookbook, which runs from the environment variables. 
2013-07-30 13:51:28	jstump	It installs into /etc/tracelyzer.conf and /etc/tracelytics IIRC
2013-07-30 13:51:58	justinabrahms	it doesn't look like we set a sample rate or method?
2013-07-30 13:52:10	justinabrahms	err "sample_rate" or "tracing_mode"
2013-07-30 13:52:16	justinabrahms	ie: the configuration stuff you asked nick to remove.
2013-07-30 13:56:36	jstump	We do.
2013-07-30 13:56:54	jstump	    "tracelytics": {

2013-07-30 13:56:54	jstump	    }
2013-07-30 13:56:59	jstump	Which is set via the templates.
2013-07-30 13:57:04	jstump	If you look at /etc/tracelyzer.conf.
2013-07-30 13:57:30	justinabrahms	only set for apache.rb ?
2013-07-30 13:57:55	justinabrahms	maybe it magically cascades?
2013-07-30 13:58:09	justinabrahms	http://www.appneta.com/2012/07/16/tracing-celery-performance/
2013-07-30 13:58:30	justinabrahms	looks like we need the `loader.load_inst_modules()` line?
2013-07-30 13:58:37	justinabrahms	so it can monkey patch celery
2013-07-30 13:59:43	jstump	Looks like we definitely need that line.
2013-07-30 13:59:53	jstump	I don't think it'd come from the apache.rb.
2013-07-30 14:01:30	jstump	But you should be able to put it into the Chef configs.
2013-07-30 14:01:33	jstump	Rather than in Python.

2013-07-31 12:29:42	nicholasserra	Haystack's elastic search backend args clash with our 'score' field. Typical. Time to fork and fix.
2013-07-31 12:31:01	jstump	Could we rename our field rather than forking an fixing?
2013-07-31 12:31:06	jstump	I hate maintaing parallel versions.
2013-07-31 12:33:06	nicholasserra	My second approach is to just rename the indexed field. Better than renaming our DB field. But hopefully i can just get the tiny fix accepted in their master and we won't have to maintain anything.
2013-07-31 12:33:26	nicholasserra	They seem to take pulls a lot. I already made a tiny docs change for them and they accepted it.
2013-07-31 12:34:32	jstump	Ah, word.
2013-07-31 12:34:35	jstump	Okay.
2013-07-31 12:34:50	jstump	nicholasserra: Did you coordinate with Tim on that move item thing?
2013-07-31 12:35:33	nicholasserra	He said he'll be back on it thursday. Dave took a look too and was in the same spot with the localstorage issue. I'm going to skype Tim tomorrow when he's available and get some answers.
2013-07-31 12:35:50	nicholasserra	I'm bummed out that that feature is still out. It's been a long fight with the FE.
2013-07-31 12:37:19	nicholasserra	But that IMC branch looks to be done too? So if all else fails that should patch it up.
2013-07-31 12:38:02	jstump	I might merge them all into master and put them on staging.
2013-07-31 12:40:46	nicholasserra	I'd say hold off until tomorrow to see if Tim and I can patch that up first then go from there
2013-07-31 12:41:34	jstump	I've already done all the FE stuff with master into a single branch.
2013-07-31 12:41:45	jstump	So I'm moving forward with that. I just might do yours in addition to the others.
2013-07-31 12:43:19	nicholasserra	Okay. Shouldn't be a bad merge with Tim's stuff. There's only a couple lines that reference the IMC I believe.
2013-07-31 12:43:30	nicholasserra	Basically just removing the item.
2013-07-31 12:47:18	wookiehangover	jstump: I think the answer is also yes
2013-07-31 12:47:28	jstump	To what question?
2013-07-31 12:47:55	wookiehangover	jstump: sorry, reading scrollback
2013-07-31 12:48:04	wookiehangover	"Is dev/upgrade-backbone ready for final testing and merging into master?"
2013-07-31 12:48:18	jstump	Ah
2013-07-31 12:48:20	jstump	wookiehangover:        options.silent ? this.expireJSONCache_() : this.change();
2013-07-31 12:48:20	jstump	Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'change'
2013-07-31 12:48:29	jstump	Did Backbone remove the change method?
2013-07-31 12:49:04	wookiehangover	there's `hasChanged()`
2013-07-31 12:49:29	wookiehangover	and a `model.changed` property
2013-07-31 12:49:37	jstump	Let me push the code.
2013-07-31 12:49:38	jstump	Hold on.
2013-07-31 12:49:59	jstump	Also, it's fucking amazing that I have to type ./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt after installing npm modules.
2013-07-31 12:50:20	wookiehangover	haha ya they should add that to your path automagically
2013-07-31 12:50:25	wookiehangover	but they don't
2013-07-31 12:50:48	jstump	dev/frontend-integration
2013-07-31 12:50:51	jstump	Pushing now.
2013-07-31 12:51:41	jstump	wookiehangover:  How do I run tests now? `[long stupid path]/grunt test` no longer works.
2013-07-31 12:52:46	wookiehangover	so install grunt-cli globally and you don't have to type the long path
2013-07-31 12:53:06	jstump	Forget the path thing.
2013-07-31 12:53:09	wookiehangover	but there are grunt local-tests
2013-07-31 12:53:14	jstump	Ah.
2013-07-31 12:53:23	wookiehangover	`grunt mocha_phantomjs`
2013-07-31 12:53:34	jstump	So local-tests fails.
2013-07-31 12:53:47	jstump	And I think what you're saying is our old `grunt test` is not represented in this new Gruntfile.coffee. 
2013-07-31 12:53:54	jstump	Which just ran the unit tests in the console. 
2013-07-31 12:54:13	wookiehangover	I can add that back in
2013-07-31 12:54:21	jstump	Yeah, we use it for CI.
2013-07-31 12:54:23	wookiehangover	oversight on my part
2013-07-31 12:54:36	jstump	(sprint.ly)MacBook-Air:sprint.ly jstump$ ./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt local-tests
2013-07-31 12:54:36	jstump	Running "local-tests:all" (local-tests) task
2013-07-31 12:54:36	jstump	>> Downloading Selenium standalone server...
2013-07-31 12:54:36	jstump	Fatal error: Invalid array length
2013-07-31 12:54:42	jstump	Not sure what the issue might be with that.
2013-07-31 12:54:53	jstump	But local-tests is broken in that dev/frontend-integration branch.
2013-07-31 12:55:07	jstump	Tests are passing in the browser though. 
2013-07-31 12:55:50	wookiehangover	I'll push a fix for the selenium thing momentarily
2013-07-31 12:55:54	jstump	k
2013-07-31 12:56:12	wookiehangover	basically it's looking for selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar in your S3 bucket and its not finding it
2013-07-31 12:56:20	wookiehangover	I had done that locally while debugging
2013-07-31 12:56:35	jstump	Ah.
2013-07-31 12:57:39	jstump	wookiehangover:  can we standardize that file on -'s for spaces?
2013-07-31 12:57:45	jstump	mocha-phantomjs for instance. 
2013-07-31 12:58:02	wookiehangover	so that's an external dep
2013-07-31 12:58:12	wookiehangover	so... not without forking it?
2013-07-31 12:58:14	jstump	Ah, perfect. Never mind then.
2013-07-31 12:58:21	wookiehangover	much apologies
2013-07-31 12:58:37	jstump	People who use _'s for spaces on the CLI should be forced to go back to POSIX school.
2013-07-31 13:00:42	wookiehangover	ha
2013-07-31 13:00:55	wookiehangover	so was chosen removed? require is erroring looking for the file
2013-07-31 13:02:38	jstump	Yeah. I fixed that.
2013-07-31 13:02:57	jstump	I haven't pushed yet though.
2013-07-31 13:03:19	wookiehangover	gotcha
2013-07-31 13:09:00	jstump	wookiehangover: pushed
2013-07-31 13:09:17	jstump	make: ../node_modules/.bin/grunt: No such file or directory
2013-07-31 13:09:17	wookiehangover	cool... I'm running into some other js errors though
2013-07-31 13:09:27	jstump	This npm stuff is going to drive me insane, isn't it?
2013-07-31 13:09:40	jstump	I'm sure there are many JS errors. I just merged in like 4 major refactors. Haha
2013-07-31 13:09:54	wookiehangover	ok
2013-07-31 13:10:06	wookiehangover	yes, the npm stuff will probably make you crazy
2013-07-31 13:10:25	jstump	Is there anything that's similar to virtualenv? Should we be using that? Why do you have a .bin and I don't? 
2013-07-31 13:10:25	wookiehangover	and it looks like grunt isn't in .bin for some reason
2013-07-31 13:10:37	wookiehangover	npm --version
2013-07-31 13:11:03	jstump	1.2.32
2013-07-31 13:11:41	wookiehangover	huh, same version here. I'm blowing my node_modules away and starting fresh... we'll see what happens
2013-07-31 13:11:48	jstump	Godspeed.
2013-07-31 13:11:58	jstump	I did a brew upgrade on npm and it's doing something with node now.
2013-07-31 13:13:48	wookiehangover	weird... maybe remove node_modules and npm install again. just worked for me with a fresh install http://cl.ly/image/422f2c1z2M2s
2013-07-31 13:14:02	wookiehangover	is there a way to turn off the global error catching?
2013-07-31 13:14:36	jstump	What do you mean?
2013-07-31 13:14:40	jstump	The global leaks stuff in Mocha?
2013-07-31 13:16:14	wookiehangover	no, this stuff https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/dev/frontend-integration/snowbird/templates/backbone.html#L68-L94
2013-07-31 13:16:44	jstump	Not that I know of, but you can muck with that template to get what you need.
2013-07-31 13:16:46	jstump	I've never had an issue with it.
2013-07-31 13:16:52	jstump	As the proper error always shows up in the console. 
2013-07-31 13:17:08	wookiehangover	it's doing its job, just makes "break on any uncaught exception" mode not work
2013-07-31 13:17:19	wookiehangover	not a big deal
2013-07-31 13:17:32	<--	nicholasserra (~Adium@24.154.8.232) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2013-07-31 13:19:02	-->	nicholasserra (~Adium@24.154.8.232) has joined #sprint.ly
2013-07-31 13:23:44	jstump	wookiehangover: Is there a reasonable way to do package caching in npm?
2013-07-31 13:24:09	jstump	wookiehangover:  pip has a way to install a requirements file w/ a cached download dir. So it only checks if versions have changed w/o downloading. Speeds up CI stuff.
2013-07-31 13:24:45	wookiehangover	so npm install will check current versions that are in node_modules
2013-07-31 13:25:44	jstump	wookiehangover: node_modules gets destroyedo n every build in Jenkins.
2013-07-31 13:25:46	jstump	(As it stands.)
2013-07-31 13:25:56	wookiehangover	but if it's too slow for CI, checking in node_modules isn't the end of the world
2013-07-31 13:26:30	jstump	Jenkins blows away your "workspace", which is where it downloads your code into.
2013-07-31 13:26:32	jstump	On every build.
2013-07-31 13:26:42	jstump	sprint.ly/node_modules ends up in workspace.
2013-07-31 13:26:52	jstump	With pip we set the download cache directory to be $HOME/.pip/cache or something.
2013-07-31 13:27:08	jstump	So the pip downloads site outside of the workspace and aren't blown away on build. Just installed from the local filesystem. 
2013-07-31 13:27:14	wookiehangover	I'd have to look into it but off the top of my head npm will only look at the local directory
2013-07-31 13:27:34	jstump	NPM Rage Level++
2013-07-31 13:27:41	jstump	Haha
2013-07-31 13:28:02	wookiehangover	haha go over to #node.js and rage on isaacs
2013-07-31 13:28:38	jstump	I think that conversation would likely lead nowhere. 
2013-07-31 13:29:14	wookiehangover	probably
2013-07-31 13:29:27	wookiehangover	there may very well be something in the api for it
2013-07-31 13:29:49	jstump	There's something called npm-cache. I'll look into it. It might be what we need.
2013-07-31 13:30:14	wookiehangover	have you messed with EventTarget at all in these refactors?
2013-07-31 13:31:07	jstump	No.
2013-07-31 13:31:13	jstump	Well, I guess I don't know.
2013-07-31 13:31:16	jstump	But I don't think so.
2013-07-31 13:31:48	jstump	Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'change'
2013-07-31 13:31:50	jstump	Still getting that.
2013-07-31 13:32:06	jstump	Which is coming from our model.js
2013-07-31 13:32:09	wookiehangover	Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'bind
2013-07-31 13:32:11	jstump	Which extends from Backbone.Model.
2013-07-31 13:32:22	jstump	It looks as though Backbone is dead or gone or wrong. 
2013-07-31 13:32:44	jstump	I don't get that error.
2013-07-31 13:33:12	jstump	I can load Dashboard and Items without any major issues. 
2013-07-31 13:33:20	wookiehangover	so backbone.model doesn't have a `change` method
2013-07-31 13:33:23	jstump	But editing a Model results in that error. 
2013-07-31 13:33:26	jstump	Oh, cool.
2013-07-31 13:34:06	wookiehangover	so I can't get the app to load... it's blowing up on EventTarget stuff
2013-07-31 13:34:12	jstump	Weird.
2013-07-31 13:34:14	jstump	Works fine for me here.
2013-07-31 13:34:22	jstump	`make clean settings.py css` + a clean DB
2013-07-31 13:34:24	jstump	Loads fine.
2013-07-31 13:34:29	jstump	I also cleared local storage and cleared cache.
2013-07-31 13:34:32	wookiehangover	will do
2013-07-31 13:35:01	jstump	So that code was written in early Dec of 2012.
2013-07-31 13:35:13	wookiehangover	hmmm
2013-07-31 13:35:20	jstump	And model.js was not modified by Tim.
2013-07-31 13:35:23	jstump	In the IMC stuff.
2013-07-31 13:36:02	jstump	Is it supposed to be this.trigger('change')?
2013-07-31 13:36:13	wookiehangover	I would think
2013-07-31 13:36:25	wookiehangover	ok, conference just ended, I'm getting kicked out
2013-07-31 13:36:32	jstump	How is the live site not just getting shit all over?
2013-07-31 13:36:41	wookiehangover	I'm really curious about that
2013-07-31 13:36:51	wookiehangover	I'll be back shortly
2013-07-31 13:38:51	jstump	Also, why wouldn't we want to expire the JSON cache all the time?
2013-07-31 13:39:07	wookiehangover	I'm not sure... You probably would
2013-07-31 13:40:01	jstump	This is weird. Haha
2013-07-31 13:40:07	jstump	I don't get why this isn't totally broken on production. 
2013-07-31 13:40:17	jstump	Unless Backbone.Model did, in fact, have a Model.change().
2013-07-31 13:40:17	wookiehangover	Ya my mind is kinda being blown right now
2013-07-31 13:40:33	wookiehangover	Lemme ask another contributor
2013-07-31 13:40:41	wookiehangover	I'm in a room with all of them
2013-07-31 13:41:47	jstump	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/master/html/static/js-sp/lib/backbone.js#L405-L434
2013-07-31 13:41:58	jstump	The version of Backbone in our repository has a change method.
2013-07-31 13:42:58	wookiehangover	Man that must be an old version
2013-07-31 13:43:24	jstump	Haha, clearly it is.
2013-07-31 13:43:51	justinabrahms	fix for npm thing:   mkdir /tmp/`hash package.json` && ln -s /tmp/`hash package.json` node_modules
2013-07-31 13:46:39	jstump	okay
2013-07-31 13:48:28	jstump	Hrm.
2013-07-31 13:48:35	jstump	It looks like set now has a silent option.
2013-07-31 13:49:02	jstump	But save() does not.
2013-07-31 13:49:28	jstump	wookiehangover:  Did we know what happened to Backbone.Model.change()?
2013-07-31 13:49:47	justinabrahms	What even gets fired on save?
2013-07-31 13:49:55	justinabrahms	s/even/event?
2013-07-31 13:50:03	jstump	justinabrahms: A number of them.
2013-07-31 13:50:17	jstump	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/master/html/static/js-sp/lib/backbone.js#L405-L434
2013-07-31 13:50:33	jstump	Basically a global change event and then change:field for every field that's changed.
2013-07-31 13:52:52	jstump	So here's the deal.
2013-07-31 13:53:01	jstump	I think we should be using Backbone.Model.save().
2013-07-31 13:53:06	jstump	With silent:true.
2013-07-31 13:57:30	jstump	wookiehangover: Can we hop on Skype for a hot minute?

2013-07-31 14:02:06	jstump	wookiehangover:  I think we need to remove saveChanges() in favor of doing it the Backbone way.
2013-07-31 14:03:47	wookiehangover	sorry, was in transit back to myhotel
2013-07-31 14:03:49	wookiehangover	samuel.breed.ql on skype

2013-07-31 14:44:45	justinabrahms	which makes sense that apache level configs wouldn't cascade down to a celery worker.

2013-08-01 10:39:10	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: https://sprint.ly/product/1/#!/item/5156
2013-08-01 10:39:23	nicholasserra	Didn't I just see a fix you had in for that smart popup setting menu?
2013-08-01 10:39:44	nicholasserra	There's a regression in the big frontend branch that's out. Just wanted your quick opinion.
2013-08-01 10:40:02	JSON_voorheez	yeah its a e.stopPropagation thing. 
2013-08-01 10:40:30	nicholasserra	Can i haz github commit link? Its up to date in his branch. Not sure where it disconnected.
2013-08-01 10:40:46	JSON_voorheez	lemme findit
2013-08-01 10:40:47	nicholasserra	That branch has a ton of little bugs actually.
2013-08-01 10:41:07	nicholasserra	And tim's probably getting tucked into bed now over there so it's hard to get on the same page.

2013-08-01 10:42:49	nicholasserra	Hm. Yeah that's up to date in his branch too. Must be something else screwing it up.
2013-08-01 10:47:37	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: In his branch, adding a stopPropagation to the very end of the onSettingsClicked_ fixes it. Is that odd practice?  
2013-08-01 10:47:43	jstump	return func(self._wrapped, *args)

2013-08-01 10:49:48	wookiehangover	I'm getting a failing unit test that looks like it left over from the Items refactor
2013-08-01 10:50:48	jstump	Yeah
2013-08-01 10:51:01	jstump	The Items collection no longer exists. JSON_voorhees can probably help.
2013-08-01 10:51:06	jstump	Or you can create a sub-item for Tim.
2013-08-01 10:51:51	JSON_voorheez	suprised only one of the tests is failing
2013-08-01 10:52:15	nicholasserra	Are you guys talking about the frontend-integration branch?
2013-08-01 10:52:30	jstump	Yeha.
2013-08-01 10:52:40	jstump	JSON_voorhees: Tim spent a bunch of time fixing the tests.
2013-08-01 10:52:51	jstump	JSON_voorhees: I think these tests might have come in after his last merge.
2013-08-01 10:54:01	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: yeah, there are a few more failing
2013-08-01 10:54:27	nicholasserra	I'm running that branch now, theres a few item card things that are broken. Not sure if Tim is in the middle of working on it or not.
2013-08-01 10:55:01	jstump	He's not that I know of.
2013-08-01 10:55:05	jstump	He was fixing other bugs.
2013-08-01 11:05:44	Yadah	JSON_voorheez: is support@ our support email addy?

2013-08-01 11:26:24	nicholasserra	Also Hi, i'm Nick.
2013-08-01 11:26:31	wookiehangover	yes, I have a few things in progress atm
2013-08-01 11:26:37	wookiehangover	hi, I'm Sam
2013-08-01 11:27:12	nicholasserra	There's a couple weird things broken on the item card i'm looking at now. Probably not related to anything you're doing.
2013-08-01 11:29:25	wookiehangover	nicholasserra: I've touch some things related to ItemCard while trying to fix unit tests
2013-08-01 11:29:47	nicholasserra	Okay. Maybe i'll keep hands off for a bit :)
2013-08-01 11:29:48	wookiehangover	actually nvm, it was ItemDialogView
2013-08-01 11:30:11	wookiehangover	and GrowlerView
2013-08-01 11:30:13	nicholasserra	I'm looking at the settings menu not staying open and the assignment menu not working.
2013-08-01 11:30:58	wookiehangover	ok, I ran into the assignment menu thing, but haven't done anything to it

2013-08-01 11:38:04	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: the grunt refactor branch has jshint support
2013-08-01 11:38:18	wookiehangover	but there are many, many things failing based on the .jshintrc
2013-08-01 11:38:19	justinabrahms	wookiehangover: I didn't see a jshint config value to check for this.
2013-08-01 11:38:26	wookiehangover	there is
2013-08-01 11:38:45	justinabrahms	this was written by a buddy of mine who hates jshint (so he made it more modular)

2013-08-01 13:22:52	Yadah	ok
2013-08-01 13:22:57	justinabrahms	We should make one.
2013-08-01 13:23:11	Yadah	indeed
2013-08-01 13:23:34	Yadah	I want to complain and ask is there something going on in the backend but I don't know if I have a real reason to complain
2013-08-01 13:23:40	justinabrahms	it should probably be "time to first card"
2013-08-01 13:23:59	justinabrahms	http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/time-to-first-tweet
2013-08-01 13:24:03	Yadah	basically I am switching from different columns in the items view and it crashed once
2013-08-01 13:24:40	justinabrahms	that's definitely bad.
2013-08-01 13:24:50	justinabrahms	we know we need to make some rendering improvements.
2013-08-01 13:24:57	Yadah	right
2013-08-01 13:24:57	justinabrahms	but we should absolutely be metricing this.
2013-08-01 13:26:02	Yadah	yeah, I was also checking out my CPU usage from istat and it was like around 20%
2013-08-01 13:26:09	Yadah	so nothing big of an impact
2013-08-01 13:26:29	nicholasserra	The sprintly product is also huge. I don't know how many items are the norm on the dashboard or items view.
2013-08-01 13:26:44	Yadah	right
2013-08-01 13:27:09	Yadah	when I used Sprint.ly at Chaotic Moon we loaded it up with around 800 or so items
2013-08-01 13:27:15	Yadah	it chugged a little
2013-08-01 13:28:30	justinabrahms	we have 3k items. there are 3 products with more items than us.
2013-08-01 13:29:44	Yadah	I know that there are many factors that will impact it, I don't how to properly measure it however 
2013-08-01 13:30:51	justinabrahms	It's helpful enough for you to be angry and complain to us. We should be able to metric it.
2013-08-01 13:31:27	Yadah	Right but I always feel I am bugging you guys with problems

2013-08-05 11:07:23	wookiehangover	also, how are you running the functional tests if the unit tests are still breaking? are you tweaking the test runner locally beforehand?
2013-08-05 11:08:56	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: can you comment on which unit tests are breaking?
2013-08-05 11:09:20	JSON_voorheez	I'm working on fixing the item dialog stuff right now, I was trying to separate it
2013-08-05 11:09:40	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: so the breaking unit tests are fixed here https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/pull/536
2013-08-05 11:09:58	wookiehangover	but I'm more just curious as to how you're running the functional tests then
2013-08-05 11:10:05	JSON_voorheez	The past couple days if there is a failing unit test i will comment those out in suite.js
2013-08-05 11:10:11	wookiehangover	cause for me it breaks on failing unit tests and bails
2013-08-05 11:10:12	wookiehangover	oic
2013-08-05 11:10:18	JSON_voorheez	just so I can finish the test im working on...
2013-08-05 11:10:25	wookiehangover	ahh, gotcha
2013-08-05 11:15:22	jstump	justinabrahms, JSON_voorhees On the phone with investors. So quite hours. :)
2013-08-05 11:15:32	justinabrahms	k. if music is loud, let me know.
2013-08-05 11:16:32	JSON_voorheez	jstump: got it :)
2013-08-05 11:17:16	justinabrahms	was hoping to use https://github.com/Maluen/Backbone-Debugger but it crashes on our app :(
2013-08-05 11:17:34	jstump	Haha, damn.
2013-08-05 11:18:31	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: I'm still seeing the functional suite choke on ".defect ul.select2-results li:nth-child(2)"
2013-08-05 11:19:22	 *	justinabrahms is also dealing with selec2 issues.
2013-08-05 11:19:36	wookiehangover	do I have to `make clean` or anything to get updated markup? not sure why it would be chocking on a selector that works for you
2013-08-05 11:20:13	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: justinabrahms I am currently fixing this
2013-08-05 11:20:28	wookiehangover	word
2013-08-05 11:20:46	JSON_voorheez	the issue is that we are setting the placeholder to 'nobody' on render even though the backing item is set..
2013-08-05 11:21:11	JSON_voorheez	unfortunatly select2 placeholder is not bound when programatically setting the value field.. :(
2013-08-05 11:28:10	nicholasserra	Anything special I have to do to get this new Make js working? Erroring out on 'html/static/build/js-sp/sprintly/collections/items.js' missing. Hm
2013-08-05 11:33:01	wookiehangover	somewhere something is still requiring collections/items
2013-08-05 11:33:15	wookiehangover	so require is really just error'ing gracefullly in the browser atm
2013-08-05 11:33:35	nicholasserra	Okay so this isn't just broken for me?
2013-08-05 11:33:59	nicholasserra	I'm trying to run functional tests and those failed right away. 
2013-08-05 11:35:12	wookiehangover	I'm pretty sure its fixed in dev/frontend-integration
2013-08-05 11:35:30	nicholasserra	That's what i'm in now. :(
2013-08-05 11:35:36	wookiehangover	womp womp
2013-08-05 11:35:45	JSON_voorheez	what it do what it do
2013-08-05 11:36:04	nicholasserra	Make js and functional tests don't run for me at all :(
2013-08-05 11:36:11	wookiehangover	common.js is still requiring collection/items
2013-08-05 11:36:15	wookiehangover	which is wrong
2013-08-05 11:36:50	wookiehangover	because I feel like I fixed that the other day
2013-08-05 11:37:58	nicholasserra	Hm.
2013-08-05 11:38:03	nicholasserra	Functional test are ran with "grunt saucelabs-tests" right?
2013-08-05 11:38:26	justinabrahms	grunt local-tests:all:chrome
2013-08-05 11:38:34	nicholasserra	That'll do it.
2013-08-05 11:39:08	nicholasserra	I'm out of touch with all of these tests right now, i'm sorry. 
2013-08-05 11:39:22	nicholasserra	Do I need to download a jar file ?
2013-08-05 11:39:49	justinabrahms	should be handled automatically if you install node modules, I believe.
2013-08-05 11:39:57	justinabrahms	I believe the README should have up-to-date info?
2013-08-05 11:40:02	wookiehangover	its actually part of the grunt command
2013-08-05 11:40:16	wookiehangover	but I think the file might be missing in the s3 bucket it pulls from
2013-08-05 11:41:10	nicholasserra	grunt test works for me
2013-08-05 11:41:15	nicholasserra	grunt local-tests:all:chrome gives corrupt jar file error
2013-08-05 11:41:40	wookiehangover	https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar
2013-08-05 11:41:48	wookiehangover	put that in js_test/lib
2013-08-05 11:42:26	wookiehangover	and make sure that line 141 of Gruntfile.coffee is pointing to it
2013-08-05 11:42:31	wookiehangover	jar : 'selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar'
2013-08-05 11:43:48	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: for some reason with the changes to our grunt stuff I have to ps aux and kill the selenium server after each failing test, I never used to have to do that
2013-08-05 11:44:16	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: yes, I'm experiencing that too
2013-08-05 11:44:18	JSON_voorheez	not a huge deal, but would be nice to have that fixed up, as its super annoying to have to kill that process each time
2013-08-05 11:44:25	wookiehangover	and was planning to look into it today
2013-08-05 11:44:47	wookiehangover	grunt 0.4.0 changed some stuff internally, and that custom grunt task might not be following all the rules
2013-08-05 11:45:41	nicholasserra	That jar got me running at least. First test still errors out for me with "Fatal error: Error response status: 10."
2013-08-05 11:47:01	JSON_voorheez	try killing the process and starting again
2013-08-05 11:47:27	JSON_voorheez	also https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
2013-08-05 11:47:42	JSON_voorheez	I think I added those to the JS_test readme but not sure
2013-08-05 11:50:07	nicholasserra	Here's my current output : https://gist.github.com/nicholasserra/a5c8ad53b69b519283d3
2013-08-05 11:51:41	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: are you getting a browser popup?
2013-08-05 11:52:13	nicholasserra	Yes, chrome opens and goes to the login page then stops.
2013-08-05 11:52:27	justinabrahms	it doesn't type into the boxes?
2013-08-05 11:52:47	justinabrahms	mine stops w/ a validatino error b/c I didn't create the test user on my latest db dump
2013-08-05 11:54:54	justinabrahms	so apparently filtered collections don't emit change events :-/
2013-08-05 11:56:20	nicholasserra	Just ran it again and it kinda worked for some reason.
2013-08-05 11:56:26	nicholasserra	Logged in but errored out on "Fatal error: Element didn't become visible"
2013-08-05 11:56:32	nicholasserra	Weird.
2013-08-05 13:03:13	wookiehangover	JSON_voorhees: so yeah apparently grunt does a global exception check now... so when the selenium driver dies, it bails before the task has a chance to kill itself
2013-08-05 13:03:19	wookiehangover	will push a fix shortly
2013-08-05 13:07:22	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: ahh i see, thanks!
2013-08-05 13:22:27	jstump	https://sprintly.uservoice.com/admin/166406-ideas/suggestions/3210460-display-an-item-s-parent-in-the-dashboard-view
2013-08-05 13:22:37	jstump	Just to give you an idea of how cantankerous customers can be.
2013-08-05 13:22:50	jstump	We have a single view in a single feature that's causing this guy to go thermonuclear. 
2013-08-05 13:23:16	jstump	I love the "you're failing the don't make me think" test as if that's a test our competitors have passed with flying colors. This shit is really hard to get right.

2013-08-05 14:02:30	JSON_voorheez	shouldn't we be able to do ItemMasterCollection.getInstance().findByPk(pk) without sending any callbacks?
2013-08-05 14:02:55	JSON_voorheez	I can just filter the collection for the item within the view, just seems like a waste
2013-08-05 14:09:03	justinabrahms	no way to know if its out of date, so you ought to get 2 callbacks. once with the initial, cached info and once with the validated info (if its different)
2013-08-05 14:09:09	justinabrahms	haven't validated it actually works that way though.
2013-08-05 14:09:38	JSON_voorheez	okay that makes sense

2013-08-05 14:51:41	Yadah_	justinabrahms: have you seen an issue where someone creates an item while you are looking at a filtered view on the dashboard and that item pops in even though it doesn't fit the filter
2013-08-05 14:51:56	justinabrahms	shouldn't happen. please file a bug.
2013-08-05 14:52:19	justinabrahms	tags: pusher, filtered (something.. whatever autocompletes for filtered)
2013-08-05 14:52:43	Yadah_	I am going to retest it on my dummy account first just to make sure but I will do
2013-08-05 15:09:43	Yadah_	just confirmed :(
2013-08-05 15:23:14	justinabrahms	*sigh* running into issues w/ chrome tab crashing.
2013-08-05 15:23:24	justinabrahms	think I might have an event loop in filtered collection stuff?
2013-08-05 15:28:26	wookiehangover	this makes me profoundly sad

2013-08-05 15:53:16	JSON_voorheez	hell yesss
2013-08-05 15:53:30	jstump	Pleasure to talk w/ you. I'm friends w/ the Freestyle guys (our companies, Winamp and Spinner were acquired by AOL simultaneously) and a user/fan of http://sprint.ly/. In fact, I'm currently championing http://sprint.ly/ internally at Mozilla to replace the venerable Bugzilla.
2013-08-05 15:53:36	jstump	It's worth repeating:

2013-08-05 15:53:51	Yadah_	So what you are saying is that Sprint.ly really whips the llamas ass
2013-08-05 15:54:17	jstump	Yadah_: The fact that this wasn't my reply proves how lame I am.
2013-08-05 15:54:27	Yadah_	damn it Joe... :)
2013-08-05 15:54:40	justinabrahms	llame.
2013-08-05 15:54:47	jstump	Indeed.
2013-08-05 15:55:05	jstump	Given that Shawn Fanning invested in my last company, I'm coming dangerously close to having the MP3 trifecta in play here.
2013-08-05 15:55:14	Yadah_	What is the latest on my youtube account? I need to share with the world my sprint.ly videos :(
2013-08-05 15:55:17	justinabrahms	xmms for life.
2013-08-05 15:55:36	justinabrahms	w/r/t bugzilla, I think that'd be really interesting.
2013-08-05 15:55:45	justinabrahms	I wonder if our product would support a company so large?
2013-08-05 15:55:56	Yadah_	So I was just going to say that
2013-08-05 15:56:15	Yadah_	With out our enterprise layer do you think they would not want us for larger products?
2013-08-05 15:56:27	justinabrahms	what I've heard from mozillians is that they'd love to switch away, but its represents many years of company knowledge.
2013-08-05 15:56:50	Yadah_	I am currently working on a champion for a company that is 85 people large to see what kind of feedback we can get
2013-08-05 15:56:59	jstump	justinabrahms: Yeah, commit that long to ANY tool and there's going to be a LOT of institutional knowledge locked up in it.
2013-08-05 15:57:34	Yadah_	Do you mean like tribal lore? or do you just mean people being comfortable using it?
2013-08-05 15:57:45	justinabrahms	tribal lore. Why did we make this change 5 years ago?
2013-08-05 15:57:46	justinabrahms	etc
2013-08-05 15:58:03	Yadah_	Hmmm
2013-08-05 15:58:41	Yadah_	if there was a migration tool for something like that they could still have that data (its been a while since I have been in Bugzilla) but they could still reference bug numbers as go to points for info
2013-08-05 15:58:55	Yadah_	with our permalink pages
2013-08-05 15:58:56	jstump	The end is near; my mom has figured out how to use FaceTime.

2013-08-05 16:02:43	jstump	I've heard they are for people who have the procreation gene. 
2013-08-05 16:05:12	Yadah_	jstump: did you explain to him that we are building out enterprise level tools or?
2013-08-05 16:06:05	jstump	Yadah_: The Mozilla guy?
2013-08-05 16:06:06	jstump	Yeah.
2013-08-05 16:06:18	jstump	I told him we're working with Engine Yard this fall on a bunch of bigger company stuff.
2013-08-05 16:06:25	jstump	And said that I'd love to align two big customers.
2013-08-05 16:06:37	Yadah_	heh that is where I was going
2013-08-05 16:06:42	Yadah_	not sure who engine yard is
2013-08-05 16:07:06	Yadah_	but I was going to suggest they could be our build partner and test the features in turn for some media and blasting out how much they love us
2013-08-05 16:09:02	jstump	I mentioned Engine Yard over Skype this weekend.
2013-08-05 16:09:09	jstump	$30M in revenues. Hosted GroupOn.

2013-08-06 11:36:50	jstump	You can drag into QSB from Someday, Backlog, and Current.
2013-08-06 11:36:56	Yadah_	roger that
2013-08-06 11:37:00	jstump	You can reorder *within* QSB as well, including on the permalink page.

2013-08-06 11:45:13	jstump	I'm just putting them into a recordings folder on my Dropbox. I can move them over.

2013-08-06 12:46:47	nicholasserra	Lol okay
2013-08-06 12:46:53	nicholasserra	Quick question
2013-08-06 12:47:12	JSON_voorheez	I'm cleaning up the tests for qsb right now, and making sure they all pass
2013-08-06 12:47:19	nicholasserra	I actually have no idea whats powering the functional tests so I don't even know where to look to get a list of supported methods for 'browser'
2013-08-06 12:47:47	nicholasserra	Obviously its webdriver but what package are we using?
2013-08-06 12:47:55	JSON_voorheez	oh its here: https://github.com/admc/wd
2013-08-06 12:48:35	nicholasserra	Awesome. What is powering the test suite? mocha?
2013-08-06 12:48:35	JSON_voorheez	should have been in the JS_TEST.mkd... I'll add it if its not
2013-08-06 12:49:25	JSON_voorheez	yeah should be

2013-08-06 12:49:50	JSON_voorheez	we include chai for the expect syntax, and 'q' for the (then) stuff
2013-08-06 12:50:10	nicholasserra	Ah.
2013-08-06 12:50:10	JSON_voorheez	pretty much all you should need is the wd stuff though
2013-08-06 12:50:20	nicholasserra	Is there a hover method on wd?
2013-08-06 12:50:48	JSON_voorheez	you can use the moveto method
2013-08-06 12:51:16	JSON_voorheez	you just getElementByCssSelector and pass that element to moveto
2013-08-06 12:51:24	nicholasserra	Awesome, thanks
2013-08-06 12:51:27	JSON_voorheez	and you should be able to test hover stuff
2013-08-06 12:51:30	JSON_voorheez	sure thing!
2013-08-06 12:52:47	JSON_voorheez	you will wanna bookmark that page for wd, you'll be referencing it alot
2013-08-06 12:54:49	nicholasserra	Lol yeah. I'm isolating my single test so I can debug it. The rest of the suite is still a little messed up for me.
2013-08-06 12:55:21	JSON_voorheez	which tests in particular?
2013-08-06 12:59:19	nicholasserra	Like half of them but it's also just straight up crashing 
2013-08-06 13:05:10	nicholasserra	moveTo does not like me.
2013-08-06 13:05:37	JSON_voorheez	have you pulled? we pushed some stuff to fix some of them yesterday
2013-08-06 13:05:45	JSON_voorheez	you can also comment out a test in suite.js
2013-08-06 13:06:34	JSON_voorheez	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/1e0b54c41eb505350c0d38d5d300404fd524d03a/js_test/functional/browser_unit/qsb_tests.js#L81
2013-08-06 13:06:37	nicholasserra	Yeah, i'm up to date.
2013-08-06 13:07:08	nicholasserra	I think it doesn't like chaining an elementByCssSelector right into a moveTo
2013-08-06 13:07:17	nicholasserra	Thank you for the reference
2013-08-06 13:11:01	nicholasserra	Is the mouse actually supposed to move or is it not visible?

2013-08-06 13:12:07	JSON_voorheez	its not visible
2013-08-06 13:15:40	nicholasserra	Why does that moveTo say "navigate to items page" for that test?
2013-08-06 13:15:40	nicholasserra	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/1e0b54c41eb505350c0d38d5d300404fd524d03a/js_test/functional/browser_unit/qsb_tests.js#L80
2013-08-06 13:15:48	nicholasserra	I thought it was just a mouse move?
2013-08-06 13:27:10	JSON_voorheez	the comment is just not right
2013-08-06 13:27:21	JSON_voorheez	I'll clean that up in this branch
2013-08-06 13:27:37	JSON_voorheez	I must have copied over some stuff and not deleted the comment
2013-08-06 13:27:38	JSON_voorheez	s
2013-08-06 13:28:49	nicholasserra	Gotcha. I'm getting the feeling that "elementByCssSelector" does not find display:none items.
2013-08-06 13:28:53	nicholasserra	I have a headache.
2013-08-06 13:30:30	JSON_voorheez	functional tests are not fun...
2013-08-06 13:32:04	nicholasserra	Yah it's a but painful.
2013-08-06 13:41:32	JSON_voorheez	also make sure you have celery running
2013-08-06 13:48:54	justinabrahms	wookiehangover: we've had difficulty with bower in the past.
2013-08-06 13:48:59	 *	justinabrahms tries to remember the issues.
2013-08-06 13:49:27	justinabrahms	It was unclear which version of something you were getting, I don't think it was possible to use it for our own dependencies (forks of a repo)
2013-08-06 13:49:46	justinabrahms	more than anything, it was terribly flaky which caused issues around unreproducable errors for new devs and our CI environment.
2013-08-06 13:50:21	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: huh, we've been using it on projects for about 6 months and haven't had problems
2013-08-06 13:50:23	justinabrahms	(its possible the "our own dependencies" thing was more an issue with having to release versions of things and we were doing rapid evolution of a modular base)
2013-08-06 13:50:42	justinabrahms	so `bower install` works more than 80% of the time for you?
2013-08-06 13:51:04	wookiehangover	yes :)
2013-08-06 13:51:05	justinabrahms	I think we were at somewhere ~ 1 in 3 times would fail with some error
2013-08-06 13:51:28	wookiehangover	when was this? it's recently been refactored and released a 1.9
2013-08-06 13:51:30	wookiehangover	*1.0
2013-08-06 13:51:35	justinabrahms	ahh, it was in jan->march timeframe
2013-08-06 13:51:53	justinabrahms	I'm +1 to some sort of module system. Will mean I can institute a build process for things like backbone-filtered-collections
2013-08-06 13:52:08	wookiehangover	so I literally picked it up and started using it feb/march
2013-08-06 13:52:12	justinabrahms	(some sort of module system == bower, I believe)
2013-08-06 13:52:22	justinabrahms	so maybe I lived through the awful and you got all the good stuff ;-P
2013-08-06 13:52:44	justinabrahms	or, more likely, you used it how it was supposed to be used.
2013-08-06 13:52:52	wookiehangover	so bower is really just for managing versions of things... requirejs / amd is the module system
2013-08-06 13:53:06	justinabrahms	right. That's more-or-less how we were using it.
2013-08-06 13:53:38	wookiehangover	so the one thing that I really think needs to be refactored is the require/build/app bootstrap process
2013-08-06 13:53:52	wookiehangover	to make it really clear what's happening, what's loading what, etc
2013-08-06 13:54:26	wookiehangover	and hopefully get the require-config into a separate file rather than call it directly from a script tag

2013-08-06 15:54:34	nicholasserra	I need to know if the functional tests increment the item number every time they are ran. I think they create a new item every time.
2013-08-06 15:54:45	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: yeah they do
2013-08-06 15:54:47	nicholasserra	I'm hardcoding item #1 but I want to make sure that will work.
2013-08-06 15:54:54	nicholasserra	Okay, so I can't hardcode an item number.
2013-08-06 15:55:26	JSON_voorheez	I was talking with justin about creating a createitemsfunction and deleteitemsfunction
2013-08-06 15:55:36	JSON_voorheez	yeah you cant hardcode item numbers
2013-08-06 15:55:48	JSON_voorheez	you could get it and store it in a variable then reference it
2013-08-06 15:56:09	nicholasserra	I just need to navigate to an item right away. So i'll just click() into one.
2013-08-06 15:58:18	JSON_voorheez	yeah just get the :first item card title 
2013-08-06 15:58:38	nicholasserra	Are the test items in someday or backlog?
2013-08-06 15:59:02	justinabrahms	I'm guessing its wherever you create them to be?
2013-08-06 16:00:13	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: mind if I pick up #5211 and #5212? (pusher reconnection errors)

2013-08-06 16:02:01	JSON_voorheez	I just added on to create and send to someday

2013-08-07 10:49:49	justinabrahms	if your results are filtered, QSB should be filtered.
2013-08-07 10:51:09	Yadah_	okay so then not on search
2013-08-07 10:51:12	Yadah_	cool got it!
2013-08-07 10:55:58	justinabrahms	Yadah_: yes on search.
2013-08-07 10:56:10	justinabrahms	search == a subset of all items, therefor QSB should dim/filter based on that.
2013-08-07 10:56:22	Yadah_	hmm its not filtering on search for me
2013-08-07 10:56:40	Yadah_	by filtering I mean dimming the boxes that don't contact the searched keyword

2013-08-07 13:40:33	justinabrahms	http://www.uta.edu/honors/faculty/petruso/crosswordpuzzle.gif -- if you turn that around (180deg) its the same picture
2013-08-07 13:40:42	justinabrahms	so write a bit of code that validates its true.
2013-08-07 13:41:37	justinabrahms	its actually a fun interview question w/ a few tiny edge cases that are interesting to talk through.
2013-08-07 13:42:36	nicholasserra	You mean besides the fact that the numbers would be upside down?
2013-08-07 13:43:10	justinabrahms	numbers always float like balloons. If you rotate it, they'll just float up.

2013-08-07 13:49:59	Yadah_	hey I need to ask a stupid question. Could I be having so many issues with sprintly due to my lack of ram?
2013-08-07 13:50:44	Yadah_	How much calculation is going on my side
2013-08-07 13:51:14	nicholasserra	If you were, it would just be slower. It wouldn't cause actual errors or wrong things to happen.
2013-08-07 13:51:15	jstump	Yadah_:  Yes.
2013-08-07 13:51:26	jstump	Yadah_:  What nicholasserra said.
2013-08-07 13:52:21	Yadah_	right right slow I get which I do have some issues with 
2013-08-07 13:52:39	Yadah_	but like the stalling issue I had yesterday where it would just spin and spin and never finish 
2013-08-07 13:54:42	jstump	No, that is not a RAM issue.
2013-08-07 13:54:47	jstump	Likely a CDN or connection issue.
2013-08-07 13:55:24	nicholasserra	For serious question. Are the product nav icons broken for everyone in the FE branch?

2013-08-07 14:30:48	jstump	wookiehangover: Basically, it usually happens when I lose connection, close laptop, wait until it's asleep, and then reopen.
2013-08-07 14:30:58	jstump	The "Reconnecting…" never goes away. Neither does the security notice.
2013-08-07 14:31:04	wookiehangover	hm, ok
2013-08-07 14:31:09	jstump	Which is when we can't connect to Pusher initiailly.

2013-08-07 14:32:24	jstump	haha

2013-08-07 16:53:14	jstump	Yadah_:  Did you tweet your blog post announcing your arrival? 
2013-08-07 16:54:54	jstump	Yadah_: Where is the blog post you want me to verify? I don't see it in Tumblr. 
2013-08-07 16:56:56	justinabrahms	wookiehangover: agreed. I think removing statemanager is going to be a bunch of code churn that will ultimately make future life awesome.
2013-08-07 16:57:07	justinabrahms	not excited about the process of doing that refactoring though.
2013-08-07 16:57:27	wookiehangover	ya, kinda like staring into the abyss
2013-08-07 16:57:51	justinabrahms	its going to involve altering the construction of a bunch of objects :-/
2013-08-07 16:58:02	wookiehangover	I didn't really realize that it was doing so much until I started writing new tests for modules that didn't have them
2013-08-07 16:58:10	jstump	justinabrahms, wookiehangover Is that something that something like a Supermodel could help with? My 10 minutes of browsing made it feel like a better implemented state manager. 
2013-08-07 16:58:14	justinabrahms	yea, just a bunch of global state.
2013-08-07 16:58:22	wookiehangover	jstump: yep
2013-08-07 16:58:50	justinabrahms	how does supermodle help?
2013-08-07 16:59:07	jstump	Ah, word. I'll leave you guys to decide how we remove StateManager, but I can say I'm in agreement it seems brittle and hurts testability. 
2013-08-07 16:59:19	jstump	justinabrahms: It keeps a global state of models.
2013-08-07 16:59:47	jstump	justinabrahms: It maintains things via relationships so that Item.pk = 1 is always the same Backbone model instance. 
2013-08-07 17:00:02	jstump	At least that was my understanding of some of its functionality. 
2013-08-07 17:00:23	jstump	That it could, in part, replace our terrible StateManager.get(Model, {data}) thing.
2013-08-07 17:00:33	justinabrahms	oh, ModelManager
2013-08-07 17:00:35	jstump	Again, based on like 10-15 minutes of poking. 
2013-08-07 17:00:39	jstump	Yeah, sorry.
2013-08-07 17:00:41	justinabrahms	state manager is the StateManager.getCurrent(Foo)
2013-08-07 17:00:58	jstump	Yeah, so that's the other part.
2013-08-07 17:01:11	jstump	It manages that single state and then you have one reference to each object.
2013-08-07 17:01:28	jstump	wookiehangover can likely chime in with way more color here.
2013-08-07 17:01:42	wookiehangover	hahah I've retyped the same message about 4 times
2013-08-07 17:01:46	justinabrahms	I think having only one of something is orthoganal to how you get the handle on that instance (which is my beef w/ statemanager)
2013-08-07 17:01:51	jstump	Regardless, there are a number of packages that address the functionality of StateManager / ModelManager.
2013-08-07 17:02:28	justinabrahms	the solution to "I need the relevant product" shouldn't be "oh, just pull the product out of global scope" but rather just to be given it.
2013-08-07 17:02:32	jstump	justinabrahms: It handles both is my understanding. The managing of state and the fetching of it, which looked to be baked into the normal model fetching. 
2013-08-07 17:02:42	wookiehangover	so StateManager can likely be replaced by enforcing dependencies from constructors
2013-08-07 17:02:50	justinabrahms	^^ +1
2013-08-07 17:03:46	jstump	Indeed. I think when we get to that point we'll have options for replacements that do not require us to home roll our own.
2013-08-07 17:04:11	jstump	Okay, I have to roll out. I'm going to be totally offline tomorrow and traveling Friday. Text me if anything urgent pops up.

2013-08-08 15:24:56	justinabrahms	south carolina has similar weird views: http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/S.C.-Confederate-flag.jpg
2013-08-08 15:25:17	JSON_voorheez	not suprised
2013-08-08 15:25:21	justinabrahms	there was a big discussion about them flying it on top of the state house, so they moved it to a memorial directly in front of the statehouse instead.
2013-08-08 15:26:14	JSON_voorheez	i'll never understand
2013-08-08 15:39:52	wookiehangover	bahh GrowlerView.getInstance() is really messing with my ability to test things
2013-08-08 15:45:01	wookiehangover	does anyone know if there are ever more than one GrowlerView instance in the app?
2013-08-08 15:45:14	wookiehangover	or can I rely on caching a reference to the singleton
2013-08-08 15:54:06	wookiehangover	this.growlerView = GrowlerView.getInstance()
2013-08-08 15:54:19	wookiehangover	and then refer to this.growlerView everywhere else in the class
2013-08-08 17:12:27	Yadah	Has any changes been push to the live product?
2013-08-08 17:23:30	JSON_voorheez	Yadah: not in 6 days
2013-08-08 17:23:54	JSON_voorheez	All of our recent changes have been staged in quite a large feature branch

2013-08-09 11:46:35	JSON_voorheez	all functional tests (besides qsb) now are self contained. creating their own test items and then cleaning up after themselves.
2013-08-09 11:46:50	JSON_voorheez	the last two are sitting in prs, waiting for justinabrahms to review.
2013-08-09 11:52:56	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: thats rad
2013-08-09 11:53:41	wookiehangover	now its just a matter of getting require out of there and un-bespoke some of the tooling for running them
2013-08-09 11:54:36	wookiehangover	earlier in the week I helped another project at QL get setup with remote saucelabs tests using mocha with this https://github.com/jmreidy/grunt-mocha-webdriver
2013-08-09 11:59:27	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: sounds good
2013-08-09 11:59:50	JSON_voorheez	yeah, id really like require out, then we could just use node's require() right?
2013-08-09 12:00:33	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: you wouldn't even need to require anything for the functional tests
2013-08-09 12:00:58	wookiehangover	the grunt task injects wd's API directly into the mocha context
2013-08-09 12:02:12	wookiehangover	and I wrote a task this morning for running against local selenium instances (for the other project, but with sprintly in the back of my mind) https://github.com/wookiehangover/grunt-mocha-selenium
2013-08-09 12:02:56	wookiehangover	and once the dust settles on dev/frontend-integration I feel like another require / grunt / test runner refactor will be in order
2013-08-09 12:06:47	JSON_voorheez	yeah that sounds awesome
2013-08-09 12:07:26	JSON_voorheez	I'd also like to setup a little script that will run each test a couple of times if it fails so that we dont have to restart the login task 10 times...
2013-08-09 12:07:55	JSON_voorheez	we could always up the timeout, but I dont think that's a good solution, its already at 30 seconds
2013-08-09 12:08:21	wookiehangover	ya it's a bummer that the login task takes as long as it does
2013-08-09 12:08:47	JSON_voorheez	i havent figured out why its so bad to login..
2013-08-09 12:09:03	JSON_voorheez	the error is always that the element is no longer in the DOM but it is!
2013-08-09 12:09:59	wookiehangover	it would also be nice to use wd's built in promises api... https://github.com/jmreidy/grunt-mocha-webdriver/blob/master/test/promiseAPI.js
2013-08-09 12:14:47	JSON_voorheez	wow i didn't even know that existed
2013-08-09 12:14:56	JSON_voorheez	would make much more sense

2013-08-12 11:12:24	justinabrahms	morning.
2013-08-12 11:12:38	Yadah	Morning
2013-08-12 11:13:43	justinabrahms	How are the videos coming along?
2013-08-12 11:14:01	Yadah	well the two I tried working on today so far are blocked by issues
2013-08-12 11:14:20	justinabrahms	:)
2013-08-12 11:14:24	Yadah	:(
2013-08-12 11:14:28	justinabrahms	Do we have a list of videos anywhere?
2013-08-12 11:14:36	Yadah	the VCS one is a bit over my head 
2013-08-12 11:14:52	Yadah	we have a new channel as we had to leave the old channel
2013-08-12 11:14:53	justinabrahms	link?
2013-08-12 11:15:07	Yadah	www.youtube.com/user/sprintly
2013-08-12 11:15:07	justinabrahms	(to the vcs one and the channel plz)
2013-08-12 11:15:25	Yadah	https://sprint.ly/product/1/#!/item/5046
2013-08-12 11:15:48	Yadah	I also have one video waiting for approval from Joe
2013-08-12 11:16:14	justinabrahms	Would it be helpful if I walked you through the VCS stuff? or would you prefer me to do the video?
2013-08-12 11:16:37	Yadah	I suppose you could create the video and I could do the voice over
2013-08-12 11:16:50	justinabrahms	ooh, that sounds even better.
2013-08-12 11:16:54	Yadah	I would imagine I would ned to setup a developer environment for that
2013-08-12 11:17:05	justinabrahms	kinda, yes.
2013-08-12 11:17:12	justinabrahms	really, you'd just need to install 3-4 things.
2013-08-12 11:17:17	justinabrahms	not a full environment.
2013-08-12 11:17:23	Yadah	I see
2013-08-12 11:17:37	Yadah	well if you didn't mind doing the video I could handle the voice over
2013-08-12 11:17:40	justinabrahms	Ideally, I'd like to see you guys have the ability to check in code to the repo.
2013-08-12 11:17:49	justinabrahms	"you guys" == matt / you / phuong.
2013-08-12 11:17:54	Yadah	Me?
2013-08-12 11:17:57	Yadah	but I don't code
2013-08-12 11:18:05	justinabrahms	But you write and we have words on our website.
2013-08-12 11:18:18	justinabrahms	thinking stuff like homepage copy, etc
2013-08-12 11:18:29	Yadah	fair enough
2013-08-12 11:18:41	Yadah	it would be interesting to learn that is for sure
2013-08-12 11:19:21	justinabrahms	everyone's commits get reviewed anyhow, so its not like you're going to break anything.
2013-08-12 11:19:22	justinabrahms	:)
2013-08-12 11:19:38	Yadah	that makes me a feel a bit more at ease
2013-08-12 11:20:02	Yadah	one quick question, do you by chance have access to all of the old videos that Joe created a while back?
2013-08-12 11:20:26	Yadah	the ones on this channel
2013-08-12 11:20:26	Yadah	http://www.youtube.com/user/sprintlyinc
2013-08-12 11:24:04	justinabrahms	no. :-/
2013-08-12 11:24:05	Yadah	I would like to take those and reupload them to the new channel
2013-08-12 11:24:40	Yadah	the contact from youtube told me I could just download a plugin to download those movies.... keep in mind this against yotube policy
2013-08-12 11:25:09	justinabrahms	:)
2013-08-12 11:25:15	justinabrahms	Joe might have the originals somewhere.
2013-08-12 11:25:15	Yadah	just freaking lame
2013-08-12 11:25:19	Yadah	I hope

2013-08-12 12:16:41	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: Is that QSB functional test not currently working? I see it's commented out. 
2013-08-12 12:34:25	JSON_voorheez	no its not
2013-08-12 12:34:28	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: 
2013-08-12 12:34:54	JSON_voorheez	I found a really specific case where add event is not fired on the qsb
2013-08-12 12:35:31	nicholasserra	Okay. I'm doing some other qsb stuff and I see the "after" function has those chained deleteItem calls. I'm using that in another file and it doesn't like it. Just curious.
2013-08-12 12:35:48	JSON_voorheez	whats happening with it?
2013-08-12 12:36:17	JSON_voorheez	if you'd like to see more examples of usage you should look at pr/555
2013-08-12 12:36:21	JSON_voorheez	or pr/56
2013-08-12 12:36:26	JSON_voorheez	*pr/556
2013-08-12 12:37:03	nicholasserra	It seems to delete one of the items in the chain but then fails on the second one.
2013-08-12 12:39:11	nicholasserra	Before and after are run before and after all of the 'it' clauses are ran, correct?
2013-08-12 12:39:27	justinabrahms	no. beforeEach is before each one
2013-08-12 12:39:35	justinabrahms	before/after is akin (I think) to setupClass in python
2013-08-12 12:40:09	nicholasserra	okay, thats what I meant. I just reread what I said and I chose bad words haha. Good.

2013-08-12 14:09:34	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: I realized what was happening with those chained createItem calls. Somehow it's assigning item[1].link and item[2].link to the same address. Hm.
2013-08-12 14:11:33	Yadah	justinabrahms: I am seeing that backend caching issues on the blocking updates as well
2013-08-12 14:11:58	Yadah	justinabrahms: when ever I click to remove the block on an item it still shows the red dot and linking to the blocker
2013-08-12 14:14:16	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: When you create two in a row, the growler errors pile up from below, so you cant grab the "view item" link correctly :P I'll prob fix that in createitem 
2013-08-12 14:24:14	Yadah	I should be able to get through this video but there will be some trickery that goes into it, But it would seem that the backend cached thing we looked at earlier today is playing its part on this bug as well. 
2013-08-12 14:24:48	Yadah	it would seem that the other item is not being updated when i remove the Block either by completing the item or simply removing the check out of the check box
2013-08-12 14:38:53	Yadah	justinabrahms: actually no, I can't. The red dot is showing to many inconsistencies. I will note it and move on

2013-08-12 15:29:43	Yadah	yup no worries, I had several bugs get in my way today on the videos that I wanted to create
2013-08-12 15:35:32	nicholasserra	Getting a test working beautifully in firefox and then having chrome shit all over it is depressing :-/
2013-08-12 15:39:52	Yadah	ok good I am not the only one having a bad day :)
2013-08-12 15:39:59	Yadah	not bad day... just challenging :)

2013-08-12 15:40:24	Yadah	lol
2013-08-12 15:40:30	nicholasserra	^^
2013-08-12 15:40:55	Yadah	I had been telling my wife that I wanted to kick out at least one video a day this week.
2013-08-12 15:41:11	Yadah	This morning I planned out 3 videos each one got knocked by a bug :(
2013-08-12 15:41:21	Yadah	on the plus side I found some bugs though ... right
2013-08-12 15:41:22	Yadah	?
2013-08-12 15:41:26	justinabrahms	yes!
2013-08-12 15:41:47	jstump	Indeed. Finding bugs is always a good thing.
2013-08-12 15:42:03	jstump	Yadah: We're working on a major release that addresses probably 90% of all of the major bugs in Sprint.ly.
2013-08-12 15:42:11	jstump	Yadah: Hoping to merge and deploy sometime this week.
2013-08-12 15:42:30	Yadah	Who is writing up the blog for said release?

2013-08-12 16:29:37	justinabrahms	Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that overlaying div!
2013-08-12 16:32:31	nicholasserra	It's that damn growler.
2013-08-12 16:32:55	nicholasserra	I don't think we have any kind of "go away" action hah.
2013-08-12 16:33:17	nicholasserra	I'm about to toss a ten second setinterval after I create the items I need.
2013-08-12 16:33:24	nicholasserra	-_-
2013-08-12 16:33:53	nicholasserra	Until I bind the escape key to kill those or something.
2013-08-12 16:33:58	nicholasserra	That might be nice.
2013-08-12 16:33:58	wookiehangover	nicholasserra: to my knowledge you have to know the class of the growl to make it go away
2013-08-12 16:34:23	nicholasserra	Can I modify dom like that in a functional test?
2013-08-12 16:34:42	justinabrahms	you can execute arbitrary javascript
2013-08-12 16:35:28	nicholasserra	$('.growl').remove() it is
2013-08-12 16:35:39	justinabrahms	:-/
2013-08-12 16:35:46	justinabrahms	scary precedent.
2013-08-12 16:35:55	JSON_voorheez	also you wont be able to use jquery
2013-08-12 16:35:58	nicholasserra	Mhm. 
2013-08-12 16:36:01	nicholasserra	Yah just about to say that.
2013-08-12 16:36:04	JSON_voorheez	since it wont work in other browsers
2013-08-12 16:36:08	nicholasserra	Do I have access to document ?
2013-08-12 16:36:18	nicholasserra	Within a test.
2013-08-12 16:36:25	JSON_voorheez	I don't know maybeh?
2013-08-12 16:36:56	nicholasserra	Hm. There's no good approach to make them go away.
2013-08-12 16:37:33	JSON_voorheez	it would be nice to have a cancel button on those
2013-08-12 16:37:45	JSON_voorheez	cus they stay in my way
2013-08-12 16:37:56	JSON_voorheez	they stay sooo long
2013-08-12 16:37:59	nicholasserra	I've ran into situations outside of this where I wanted those growler boxes to get out of my way. Would an ESC keypress be something I should toss in?
2013-08-12 16:37:59	justinabrahms	just make the browser screen wider? #notactuallyhelping
2013-08-12 16:38:04	nicholasserra	lol
2013-08-12 16:38:26	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: That sounds reasonable to me.
2013-08-12 16:38:55	justinabrahms	escape is also used for: defocusing text element, (ideally) cancelling a drag motion
2013-08-12 16:38:58	JSON_voorheez	see common/key_bindings.js
2013-08-12 16:39:05	JSON_voorheez	ohhh yeah duh
2013-08-12 16:39:10	JSON_voorheez	didn't think of that
2013-08-12 16:39:25	JSON_voorheez	ctrl-x ctrl-c
2013-08-12 16:39:32	JSON_voorheez	:wq!
2013-08-12 16:39:46	justinabrahms	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkU9oVGr1KE
2013-08-12 16:42:01	JSON_voorheez	it would probably be okay to dismiss those with esc as long as it doesn't swallow the event there
2013-08-12 16:42:26	nicholasserra	Yah, if we link it up in key_bindings.js just don't prevent default.
2013-08-12 16:42:39	JSON_voorheez	right-o
2013-08-12 16:42:46	nicholasserra	Is there a statemanager for the growlers or should we just kill them with a css selector?
2013-08-12 16:43:38	JSON_voorheez	they are actual views so we should make sure we are cleaning them up properly
2013-08-12 16:44:24	nicholasserra	So we can't toss this in key_bindings. It'll have to be on the growler view itself.
2013-08-12 16:44:45	JSON_voorheez	well it needs to be a global listener
2013-08-12 16:45:00	JSON_voorheez	but it may work withing the growler view
2013-08-12 16:45:37	nicholasserra	That's why I was wondering if there was a way to fetch all of the current growler views, but I don't think there's a running collection of them or anything.

2013-08-13 09:55:56	nicholasserra	( ^_^)／
2013-08-13 09:58:52	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: where are you on #5236 and #5200 ?
2013-08-13 09:59:30	nicholasserra	Just opened a pull for 90% of 5236
2013-08-13 10:00:29	nicholasserra	5200 is kinda odd and needs some discussion about how we want to handle those item card popups. Might need a bit of a restructure to get those working nice.
2013-08-13 10:02:24	justinabrahms	is that an issue specific to the IMC branch?
2013-08-13 10:02:33	justinabrahms	(I think you might have mentioned in the ticket that it wasn't?)
2013-08-13 10:02:49	justinabrahms	I really want to get this branch on staging, so trying to determine what needs to happen for that.
2013-08-13 10:03:26	nicholasserra	That issue is currently in production, so no, it doesn't need to be in the IMC branch.
2013-08-13 10:03:45	justinabrahms	okay. Let's punt on that one until IMC is done.
2013-08-13 10:04:19	nicholasserra	Okay. I'm going to do the last couple tests related to 5236 today. The bulk of them are in the PR i just made though.
2013-08-13 10:04:25	justinabrahms	rock.
2013-08-13 10:04:38	justinabrahms	that'll just leave a few bugs JSON_voorheez has left.
2013-08-13 10:05:23	nicholasserra	I'll see if any of his tickets are things I could patch up quick too.
2013-08-13 10:06:25	nicholasserra	Looks like he has some pull requests out for a couple too.
2013-08-13 10:12:07	JSON_voorheez	wookiehangover: I'm trying to add a dependency to bower, I'm referencing https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/pull/545/files do I really need to add the shim in 4 different places?
2013-08-13 10:12:50	wookiehangover	JSON_voorheez: unfortunately, yes.
2013-08-13 10:12:55	JSON_voorheez	ahh okay
2013-08-13 10:13:03	JSON_voorheez	we should add that to grunt or something.
2013-08-13 10:13:05	justinabrahms	seems like its b/c of relative pathing stuff?
2013-08-13 10:13:10	wookiehangover	there are a few things blocking us from doing a unified require config...
2013-08-13 10:13:18	JSON_voorheez	oh
2013-08-13 10:13:40	wookiehangover	so, for one, there's path data that's passed in from the server on backbone.html
2013-08-13 10:13:57	JSON_voorheez	right
2013-08-13 10:14:24	wookiehangover	second, the way require is bundled with jquery would need to be un-done so that require could be pointed at a config file

2013-08-13 11:22:32	JSON_voorheez	haha nice
2013-08-13 11:22:49	Yadah	I am not an atheist myself but good grief this woman must have been insanely brave
2013-08-13 11:23:02	grant_	is that a woman or a man?
2013-08-13 11:23:24	Yadah	I would applaud her for just standing up for what she believes.
2013-08-13 11:23:37	Yadah	Yeah that is a horrible picture

2013-08-13 11:24:05	jstump	She definitely is not what I'd refer to as "a looker".
2013-08-13 11:24:34	Yadah	next time send them a more risqué picture. Then maybe they will undestand.
2013-08-13 11:24:44	Yadah	understand*

2013-08-13 14:17:09	jstump	Just crossed into 450+ FE tests in this branch I'm working on.
2013-08-13 14:17:14	jstump	It feels really good.
2013-08-13 14:17:16	jstump	Haha
2013-08-13 14:44:14	justinabrahms	fyi: frontend-integration is boned (items page is broken). Working on it.
2013-08-13 14:44:53	Yadah	jstump: Speaking of frontend what did you think of that resume I sent you?
2013-08-13 14:50:26	jstump	Yadah: Justin and I reviewed it, but haven't had a chance to get back to you. We've got 3 candidates w/ onsite interviews being scheduled.
2013-08-13 14:50:41	jstump	So no action until we give those folks the first dibs they got being in the pipeline first.
2013-08-13 14:50:56	Yadah	ok just curious
2013-08-13 14:51:02	jstump	(Nicholas being one of those folks!)
2013-08-13 14:51:16	jstump	Yadah: I think we'd be interested in talking to him though about FE work.
2013-08-13 14:51:33	jstump	Yadah:  Just didn't want to waste his time given we've got 3 candidates and 2 spots as it stands. 
2013-08-13 14:52:47	Yadah	understood
2013-08-13 15:01:48	jstump	Yadah: I don't know a lot of MS shops, but I know of one that might be hiring and is okay with remote.
2013-08-13 15:01:59	jstump	Yadah: I can also forward him to the First Round Capital talent team.
2013-08-13 15:02:29	Yadah	Sure thing 
2013-08-13 15:02:52	Yadah	he is employed at the moment he was curious about my post and what not
2013-08-13 15:04:22	jstump	Yadah: Word. If he flips to actively looking, my network is at his disposal. 
2013-08-13 15:04:36	Yadah	Cool
2013-08-13 15:05:03	Yadah	I am very close to being done with the first draft of the interview with Arin
2013-08-13 15:05:11	jstump	Sweet!
2013-08-13 15:05:26	Yadah	Was he in a sharknado when he was talking to you?
2013-08-13 15:06:04	jstump	Yadah: Haha, no, but I think he was outside on his back patio. 
2013-08-13 15:06:19	Yadah	I can't mute out him lighting up his cig which was killing me
2013-08-13 15:10:40	Yadah	jstump: Guess what I just found
2013-08-13 15:10:52	Yadah	http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/faq.html
2013-08-13 15:11:12	justinabrahms	ooh. video.
2013-08-13 15:11:23	Yadah	they have a tool to split the audio tracks on each side of the call which will allow me to erase all wind nose and lighter flicks
2013-08-13 15:11:27	justinabrahms	productpeople.tv do video sometimes, which I think is cool.
2013-08-13 15:11:57	Yadah	I don't mind video just not over the internet because its so jumpy and the quality is usually crap
2013-08-13 15:12:04	justinabrahms	*shrug*
2013-08-13 15:12:11	justinabrahms	I find it better than audio only.
2013-08-13 15:12:21	justinabrahms	also, when doing a podcast, I like to gauge reactions.
2013-08-13 15:12:31	Yadah	it is easier to monitize video for sure
2013-08-13 15:12:44	Yadah	have you seen the videos Joe did?
2013-08-13 15:12:44	jstump	Until I get a computer that can transcode video while recording it, video is off the table.
2013-08-13 15:12:52	justinabrahms	hah
2013-08-13 15:12:55	Yadah	lol
2013-08-13 15:13:15	jstump	"A firearms instructor accidentally shot a student while teaching a gun-safety class on Saturday in Fairfield County to people seeking permits to carry concealed weapons."
2013-08-13 15:13:33	justinabrahms	Fairfield County SC?
2013-08-13 15:14:15	Yadah	sounds like he needed more training did he kill the student?
2013-08-13 15:15:30	jstump	One would hope that there's a high level of training before one can be certified as a trainer to teach such training classes. 
2013-08-13 15:15:37	jstump	http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/08/12/concealed-carry-accidental-shooting.html
2013-08-13 15:16:09	jstump	"Dunlap apparently didn’t know that the gun was loaded"
2013-08-13 15:16:26	Yadah	...
2013-08-13 15:16:28	jstump	If we'd only regulate guns less, this stuff wouldn't happen. 
2013-08-13 15:16:43	jstump	The answer to people doing stupid things is always less oversight and less regulation. 
2013-08-13 15:17:02	jstump	I certainly know from my management experience that poor employees tend to greatly improve when you talk to them less and have fewer 1:1s. 
2013-08-13 15:17:13	justinabrahms	I read that as "If we'd only regulate less guns..."
2013-08-13 15:17:19	jstump	haha
2013-08-13 15:18:04	Yadah	I think we need better regulations as well, however I don't think we should fool ourselves into thinking crooks will follow gun laws and regulations
2013-08-13 15:18:27	justinabrahms	at least in this case, it wasn't a crook who was shooting people.
2013-08-13 15:18:59	justinabrahms	also, higher regulation ought to translate into lower gun availability.
2013-08-13 15:19:02	jstump	Yadah: Those crooks are actually actively exploiting loopholes to get the guns now. This is the scary part.
2013-08-13 15:19:07	Yadah	dude was 73 years old... just saying maybe there should be an age limit on trainers
2013-08-13 15:19:21	jstump	Haha, there is for cars. 
2013-08-13 15:19:27	Yadah	exactly
2013-08-13 15:21:33	jstump	There is substantial data that shows removing guns from a population doesn't push violence into other forms of violence, BTW. Knife violence in AU and UK is no worse than in the US.
2013-08-13 15:22:19	jstump	There's also some great data that shows regulation of the car industry has dramatically reduced car deaths (go figure).
2013-08-13 15:22:43	jstump	Gun zealots (any zealot really) make no sense to me.
2013-08-13 15:22:47	Yadah	Oh I don't think that would be the case, I wish it were. I would hope you have a better chance of surviving a knife fight than a gun fight
2013-08-13 15:22:53	jstump	It's not about data or safety. It's about being able to blow shit up.
2013-08-13 15:23:03	Yadah	Its the fun of it
2013-08-13 15:23:05	jstump	I mean just the simple rate of the violence occurring. 
2013-08-13 15:23:27	Yadah	basically people who like guns like them because they find them fun
2013-08-13 15:23:31	jstump	In other words, the absence of access to guns doesn't result in knife attacks tripling. 
2013-08-13 15:23:53	jstump	I honestly don't know what attracts them. I've been terrified of them since I was a kid and I grew up in a VERY gun happy home. 
2013-08-13 15:24:16	Yadah	right I agree that is not going to happen I was saying I wouldn't mind if it did. I think I could run away from a knife attacker
2013-08-13 15:24:22	jstump	Joe as a kid: "You want me to hold something that my uncle made in his garage that creates tiny explosions and shoots lead? No thanks."
2013-08-13 15:24:28	justinabrahms	see also campaign finance reform, etc. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/12/gun_violence_research_nra_and_congress_blocked_gun_control_studies_at_cdc.html
2013-08-13 15:26:13	Yadah	What are you a fanatic about?
2013-08-13 15:26:27	justinabrahms	me?
2013-08-13 15:26:33	Yadah	both of yous
2013-08-13 15:26:41	jstump	Computers.
2013-08-13 15:26:44	jstump	Well, code.
2013-08-13 15:26:45	jstump	Haha
2013-08-13 15:26:46	justinabrahms	clean apis.
2013-08-13 15:26:48	jstump	Yeah.
2013-08-13 15:26:53	Yadah	So why do you need a more powerful computer?
2013-08-13 15:27:03	Yadah	clean apis :)
2013-08-13 15:27:35	justinabrahms	more powerful computer == laziness, more or less.
2013-08-13 15:28:03	justinabrahms	I can afford to be more patient with developers who write inefficient code (like us and our 100% cpu-on-load website)
2013-08-13 15:28:05	jstump	Haha, yes.
2013-08-13 15:28:37	Yadah	As a devils advocate I would say "Why do you need a more powerful one" which is the same question anti gun people as all the time
2013-08-13 15:28:49	Yadah	you want it because you want in some cases you don't need it
2013-08-13 15:29:11	justinabrahms	I would draw the line at death-machine-as-recreation
2013-08-13 15:29:31	Yadah	its only a death machine if you point at someone to kill
2013-08-13 15:29:37	justinabrahms	if you've fired a pistol, you'd realize (or at least I did) that those are machines of death. They're not for hunting. They're for murdering.
2013-08-13 15:29:38	Yadah	I could do the same with my computer
2013-08-13 15:29:50	justinabrahms	a rifle is a hunting mechanism.
2013-08-13 15:29:52	jstump	Yadah: Not having an AR-15 doesn't keep me from recording video for podcasts. Maybe if I was a SWAT team member saying, "I need an AR-15 because this six shooter significantly holds me back from performing at my job optimally." it'd work.
2013-08-13 15:30:26	Yadah	I am saying from the stand point of something you like for fun
2013-08-13 15:30:30	Yadah	take job roles out of it
2013-08-13 15:30:41	Yadah	so like you like computer for playing games
2013-08-13 15:30:51	jstump	I understand the nature. Horsepower in cars is a good analogy. 
2013-08-13 15:31:08	jstump	I don't NEED 300 RWHP in my 4 door sedan, but it sure makes the highway a fuck ton of fun. 
2013-08-13 15:31:20	Yadah	yup 
2013-08-13 15:31:36	jstump	I understand the need to satisfy one's lizard brain. 
2013-08-13 15:31:41	Yadah	so why couldn't someone say on a sunday morning I just want to fire a few rounds down range
2013-08-13 15:31:51	Yadah	and doing it with a ar-15 is a lot more fun
2013-08-13 15:31:59	jstump	I just try to focus my lizard brain desires on things that don't make me 40x more likely to kill myself or a loved one.
2013-08-13 15:32:19	 *	justinabrahms also has issues with car culture. #portlandhippie
2013-08-13 15:32:32	jstump	Agreed on car culture. 
2013-08-13 15:33:00	jstump	Yadah: If the laws were such that a person could go to a range, temporarily use an AR-15 for fun, and then give it back; all within a controlled environment, I'd be more on board.
2013-08-13 15:33:10	Yadah	What you don't like fast cars or guns? Oh wait y'all (note the y'all) don't live in Texas
2013-08-13 15:33:14	Yadah	:)
2013-08-13 15:33:27	jstump	Yadah: I will point out that I can't go and drive my drag car around on the road.
2013-08-13 15:33:43	jstump	And the safety systems in the car and where they can be use are highly regulated. 
2013-08-13 15:33:43	 *	justinabrahms is from SC.
2013-08-13 15:33:49	 *	jstump is from MI.
2013-08-13 15:33:50	Yadah	okay okay hold on lets see if we can agree on this 
2013-08-13 15:34:07	Yadah	Legalizing medical weed?
2013-08-13 15:34:16	justinabrahms	s/medical// ++
2013-08-13 15:34:27	Yadah	++ being?
2013-08-13 15:34:30	justinabrahms	+1
2013-08-13 15:34:39	jstump	I think weed should be legalized and regulated the same way booze is.
2013-08-13 15:34:44	justinabrahms	s/medical// means (replace the word medical with nothing)
2013-08-13 15:34:50	Yadah	Okay whew!
2013-08-13 15:34:54	jstump	I think the same about prostitution and almost all drugs. 
2013-08-13 15:34:56	Yadah	finally something we all agree on lol
2013-08-13 15:35:50	Yadah	I saw that doc with Sanja Gupta changing his mind on weed, I am like yeah that should have happen years ago
2013-08-13 15:36:12	Yadah	The only thing that keeps me from lighting up is that I live in a state where I would be hauled off and the key thrown away
2013-08-13 15:36:31	jstump	Given that we largely made weed illegal because Mexican migrants preferred it to booze was enough of a reason for me.
2013-08-13 15:36:37	Yadah	I have a friend who has a brain tumor that I am sure it could help her have a better life
2013-08-13 15:37:56	jstump	Yadah: I have a few funny stories about pot and TX. Suffice it to say, people in the NW of this country view pot dramatically differently than the average Texan. Haha
2013-08-13 15:38:29	Yadah	Yeah it suck, trust me if you required me to move I wouldnt put up much of a fight
2013-08-13 15:39:02	Yadah	the only bad thing about Oregon is that population mix is way off
2013-08-13 15:39:07	justinabrahms	agreed.
2013-08-13 15:39:13	Yadah	okay funny story
2013-08-13 15:39:22	justinabrahms	being from the south.. it feels weird and unnatural to be surrounded by 90% white people.
2013-08-13 15:40:21	Yadah	I was flown to eugene for an interview with a  company called GarageGames. When I get to the door and knock on it on a saturday morning. They answer and I kid you not. The first thing out of their mouth
2013-08-13 15:40:29	Yadah	Oh my God you are black...
2013-08-13 15:40:39	Yadah	I was like uh .. yes I am 
2013-08-13 15:40:53	jstump	o_O
2013-08-13 15:40:57	jstump	Who says that?
2013-08-13 15:41:08	Yadah	someone who has never seen many dark people
2013-08-13 15:41:11	jstump	Like what part of anyone's brain made that make sense. 
2013-08-13 15:41:41	Yadah	my wife looked into Oregon and found that hispanics and blacks are extremely rare and that our kids would stick out like sore thumbs
2013-08-13 15:42:07	jstump	Yadah: Definitely true in Eugene. Not true in Portland (though PDX is very white). 
2013-08-13 15:42:08	Yadah	Think about how many black people you have seen in technology? Now take that and narrow that to games
2013-08-13 15:42:40	jstump	Don't get me started on how fucked this industry is. Top to bottom.
2013-08-13 15:43:32	justinabrahms	http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/41/4159000.html
2013-08-13 15:43:37	Yadah	Yeah I have sat on diversity panels for the industry for both the lady types and blacks
2013-08-13 15:43:47	justinabrahms	portland is ~6% black compared to oregons ~1%
2013-08-13 15:44:07	Yadah	wow
2013-08-13 15:44:21	jstump	That's still about half of what the black population is as a whole I think?
2013-08-13 15:44:25	jstump	10-12% of the US population?
2013-08-13 15:44:36	Yadah	1.4
2013-08-13 15:44:41	justinabrahms	http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/45/4515355.html -- my hometown for comparison
2013-08-13 15:44:41	Yadah	eugene lol
2013-08-13 15:44:49	justinabrahms	19% vs state's 28%
2013-08-13 15:46:00	Yadah	http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12/12111.html
2013-08-13 15:46:06	Yadah	i hate my hometown 
2013-08-13 15:46:28	justinabrahms	20% old people.
2013-08-13 15:46:48	Yadah	man you have no idea
2013-08-13 15:46:56	Yadah	all the sterotypes are true
2013-08-13 15:47:02	Yadah	all of them
2013-08-13 15:47:59	jstump	I'm pretty sure I'm related to 100% of the redneck / white people stereotypes. 
2013-08-13 15:49:07	justinabrahms	my family is all from backwoods WV and KY.
2013-08-13 15:49:58	jstump	You might be related to some redneck stereotypes I don't even know about.
2013-08-13 15:50:05	Yadah	lol
2013-08-13 15:50:33	JSON_voorheez	my family is dc and wv, pretty much complete opposites

2013-08-14 11:40:14	JSON_voorheez	much nicer
2013-08-14 11:40:20	nicholasserra	I like it. I think you're right on that helper piggybacking off of the other one. I'm patching that now.
2013-08-14 11:50:19	justinabrahms	http://i.imgur.com/eswVJUE.png -- also, that's the difference between the chain api and the Q object API

2013-08-14 11:52:19	justinabrahms	also note, that wasn't actually tested (can't run those wd tests atm) but based on example docs: https://github.com/admc/wd/blob/master/examples/example.chain.chrome.js
2013-08-14 11:53:42	nicholasserra	Okay. I just pushed those fixes for the helpers and pretty imports. 
2013-08-14 11:53:52	nicholasserra	Do we want to change everything over to the chain api?
2013-08-14 11:59:04	justinabrahms	not yet.
2013-08-14 11:59:28	justinabrahms	i'd like to find a complicated view, try it out there to make sure it has all the functionality we need without being gross.

2013-08-14 12:37:23	justinabrahms	he's around.
2013-08-14 12:51:23	nicholasserra	Just wondering about that create_story helper. I see a reference to it in text but I wanna make sure he doesn't have that stashed away before i create it.
2013-08-14 12:55:41	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: you can create it, I never finished that

2013-08-14 13:16:22	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheesz Any reason you wanted create_story in it's own file? I think they can be combined.
2013-08-14 13:17:01	nicholasserra	Actually that might get a little messy with the chain of things.

2013-08-14 14:33:38	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: so have you looked into the built-in Q api for wd? I'm not seeing a clear benefit of chain over the built in promises
2013-08-14 14:37:31	justinabrahms	wookiehangover: the `then` seems unnecessary when you could instead say something about what it is you're actually doing.
2013-08-14 14:38:00	justinabrahms	ie: instead of saying:  I went to the store then got some groceries then paid for them then put them in my fridge, I say: I went to the store, got some groceries, and put them in my fridge.
2013-08-14 14:38:37	justinabrahms	It seems like the difference between the native Q and the one we're using is instead of Q.first() you just use browser? 
2013-08-14 14:39:00	wookiehangover	sure, but I think that there's some benefit of having granularity of a new function scope for each step, in case you wanted to make multiple assertions
2013-08-14 14:39:06	wookiehangover	but I get what you're laying down
2013-08-14 14:39:28	justinabrahms	https://github.com/admc/wd/blob/master/examples/example.chain.chrome.js
2013-08-14 14:39:36	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: ya, the built in version would make it so that that the global Q and the withDefer helpers could go away
2013-08-14 14:39:48	justinabrahms	you can make additional assertions by just passing a function when you want one.
2013-08-14 14:39:54	wookiehangover	ahh, cool
2013-08-14 14:40:20	justinabrahms	At least.. that's how I'm reading it.
2013-08-14 14:40:20	justinabrahms	I need to get these passing locally so I can actually try it out
2013-08-14 14:40:24	wookiehangover	the nested browser.next stuff seems a bit confusing at first
2013-08-14 14:40:48	justinabrahms	agreed. I want to try it out on one of our larger tests to see what it looks like in practice.

2013-08-14 14:44:30	jstump	It's a serious rabbit hole. 
2013-08-14 14:44:49	jstump	The data structures in numpy and related packages are mind blowing.

2013-08-14 14:45:16	nicholasserra	You'd think once you venture into that world of crunching numbers and scientific data, you'd move to a faster language.
2013-08-14 14:45:36	jstump	nicholasserra: Except Python has the very best academic libraries available of any language. 
2013-08-14 14:45:51	jstump	nicholasserra: There are no peers to things like numpy, scipy, etc.
2013-08-14 14:45:51	justinabrahms	python is fast for development.
2013-08-14 14:45:53	nicholasserra	Interesting. That's a different world to me.
2013-08-14 14:45:55	nicholasserra	Yeah.
2013-08-14 14:46:06	nicholasserra	But it's definitely not built for speed.
2013-08-14 14:46:10	jstump	Additionally, Python is very easy for non-developers to learn and use (e.g. academics wanting to process information).
2013-08-14 14:46:17	jstump	That's why there's Dumbo. :)
2013-08-14 14:46:23	justinabrahms	That's like saying if you're writing important things you should switch to archival pens. What you should probably reach for is w/e helps you get the ideas out quickly. :)

2013-08-14 14:47:41	nicholasserra	But yeah, I agree. It's a balancing act of speed of development vs optimization once you have something working.

2013-08-14 15:59:01	wookiehangover	starting to refactor the functional test suite to not use require.js... things are looking good =) wd promises are optional but baked in, including / excluding tests to be run in way more straightforward
2013-08-14 15:59:12	justinabrahms	!!
2013-08-14 15:59:55	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: good !! or bad !! ?
2013-08-14 16:00:19	justinabrahms	happy to defer to you on wd promises vs chain. I don't mind either. page objects are the biggest win.

2013-08-14 16:00:52	JSON_voorheez	lol
2013-08-14 16:01:02	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: so I read into pageobjects, but wasn't quite sure how best to approach the abstraction

2013-08-14 16:03:08	justinabrahms	I've not done it in javascript where async is a thing, so that might make things a little weird
2013-08-14 16:03:35	justinabrahms	but in python land, it's just objects that expose methods that are abstractions on the thing you actually want to do, which under the hood have a handle on the selenium browser object and make appropriate calls.
2013-08-14 16:04:55	justinabrahms	ie: d = new Dashboard(browse); ai = d.addItem(); ai.setTitle('test'); ai.setDescription('foo"); item_number = ai.addToBacklog()   assert(d.getBacklogColumn().contains(item_number)
2013-08-14 16:05:17	justinabrahms	if it would be helpful, I can write up an API that seems sane?
2013-08-14 16:07:22	justinabrahms	I think the key would be to rewrite single tests at a time, rather than trying to write generic objects that do the thing you want, then rewriting the tests (ie: incremental)
2013-08-14 16:10:54	JSON_voorheez	justinabrahms: I am also seeing what nick was talking about with the send-to-backlog loop

2013-08-14 17:17:54	JSON_voorheez	apparently mouseenter is not working for us
2013-08-14 17:19:07	wookiehangover	hmmm ok
2013-08-14 17:19:27	wookiehangover	the event itself or the jquery method mouseenter()

2013-08-14 17:21:14	JSON_voorheez	My question is more so what would it take to upgrade to newest jquery and drop that require-jquery thing?

2013-08-14 17:21:44	JSON_voorheez	I feel like that would fix it up. I think we help off due to $.browser in some of our plugins
2013-08-14 17:21:58	JSON_voorheez	Do you remember if there was any other reasons?
2013-08-14 17:23:00	wookiehangover	so the jquery compatibility plugin will take care of $.browser and other deprecated stuff that you might be using
2013-08-14 17:23:33	JSON_voorheez	right it's only in a couple more plugins 
2013-08-14 17:23:44	JSON_voorheez	things I would like to get upgraded regardless
2013-08-14 17:23:50	wookiehangover	but I cant think of any other reasons to not pull it out
2013-08-14 17:24:00	JSON_voorheez	cool
2013-08-14 17:24:08	wookiehangover	and just load from a cdn or stick it into the require build
2013-08-14 17:24:31	wookiehangover	fwiw I'd like to see how big the build actually is if all the modules are compiled into a single file
2013-08-14 17:24:54	JSON_voorheez	yeah i hear that
2013-08-14 17:25:41	wookiehangover	that would eliminate a big chunk of the require complexity

2013-08-15 10:56:59	jstump	How would I best go about making sure a variable in JS has something in it?
2013-08-15 10:57:15	jstump	The values are likely going to be: undefined, a Number, or a String.
2013-08-15 10:58:06	jstump	(!_.isUndefined(value) && String(value).length > 0) ?
2013-08-15 10:59:38	nicholasserra	Outside of our codebase? We have that isDefinedAndNotNull helper
2013-08-15 10:59:43	nicholasserra	for in it.
2013-08-15 10:59:53	jstump	That's in helpers, yes?
2013-08-15 11:00:15	nicholasserra	isDefAndNotNull
2013-08-15 11:00:17	nicholasserra	Yes.
2013-08-15 11:00:44	nicholasserra	You don't need to cast to String either.
2013-08-15 11:00:54	nicholasserra	'teststring'.length works
2013-08-15 11:01:07	jstump	Yes, but Number(10).length does not. ;)
2013-08-15 11:01:15	jstump	(Some of the values can be integers.) 
2013-08-15 11:01:34	nicholasserra	Ah, gotcha
2013-08-15 11:01:48	jstump	isDefinedAndNotNull resulted in a re-broken test.
2013-08-15 11:01:56	jstump	I'm going to leave this for now. It works and tests pass.
2013-08-15 11:04:38	nicholasserra	justinabrahms jstump I'm seeing a regression on stopping a current item via the red stop button on the item card. 
2013-08-15 11:04:48	nicholasserra	'TypeError: maxItem.get is not a function'
2013-08-15 11:08:05	justinabrahms	ze commits. ze have landed!
2013-08-15 11:08:23	justinabrahms	http://ci.sprint.ly/job/sprint.ly/2098/
2013-08-15 11:24:24	justinabrahms	py.test = http://pytest.org/latest/assert.html
2013-08-15 11:31:47	nicholasserra	Did we upgrade underscore?
2013-08-15 11:31:54	justinabrahms	I believe so, yes.
2013-08-15 11:31:59	nicholasserra	That'll do it
2013-08-15 11:32:02	nicholasserra	XD
2013-08-15 11:39:31	nicholasserra	There's so many underscore files :-/ JSON_voorheez or wookiehangover do you guys know what version we bumped to and from by chance? :)
2013-08-15 11:40:01	jstump	A diff of that branch will show quickly.
2013-08-15 11:40:08	jstump	Look at the next oldest version of that underscore.js file.
2013-08-15 11:40:25	nicholasserra	I'm just not sure which one is being used since we've changed up the whole require setup.
2013-08-15 11:41:16	nicholasserra	I'm assuming https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/master/html/static/js-sp/lib/underscore.js still
2013-08-15 11:41:51	nicholasserra	1.3.3 to 1.5.1 I believe
2013-08-15 11:42:22	wookiehangover	nicholasserra: yep
2013-08-15 11:42:35	nicholasserra	I think my issue is valid. There was a patch for what i'm seeing 11 months ago
2013-08-15 11:42:36	nicholasserra	https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/728
2013-08-15 11:42:49	nicholasserra	min and max functions now return Infinity and -Infinity when empty arrays are used
2013-08-15 11:53:06	justinabrahms	wave powered drainage pump: http://mlkshk.com/r/TGNZ  -- like engineering magic
2013-08-15 12:18:49	nicholasserra	"Element is no longer attached to the DOM" should really tell you what element it's talking about.

2013-08-16 11:45:23	justinabrahms	okay, so 6 bugs to fix that I found.

2013-08-16 12:00:56	chrisforrette	Yadah: it's separate from the live site so you kinda have to
2013-08-16 12:01:07	Yadah	Okay let me trying that I was trying to sign in with the one from live
2013-08-16 12:01:08	Yadah	ok
2013-08-16 12:02:42	Yadah	i am in with no problems
2013-08-16 12:04:25	Yadah	justinabrahms: I just tried assigning an item to Nobody from the items view and it just pops back to my name
2013-08-16 12:05:19	justinabrahms	cool. mind filing a bug?
2013-08-16 12:05:29	Yadah	yup
2013-08-16 12:05:37	Yadah	are there bugs I should be checking for in this build
2013-08-16 12:05:38	justinabrahms	tag it with imc-release
2013-08-16 12:05:46	Yadah	roger that
2013-08-16 12:05:59	justinabrahms	I don't htink there are any particular bugs to look out for.
2013-08-16 12:08:55	Yadah	justinabrahms: the reject feature seems bugged
2013-08-16 12:09:29	Yadah	I hit reject when the item is in the backlog column and it moves to complete
2013-08-16 12:09:37	justinabrahms	that's what its supposed to do.
2013-08-16 12:09:50	justinabrahms	we have a ticket in someday for it to dissappear more.
2013-08-16 12:10:05	Yadah	How is rejecting an item and marking it invalid moving it to complete?
2013-08-16 12:10:15	Yadah	Not sure I understand the logic of the feature
2013-08-16 12:10:42	justinabrahms	the separation is "I'm not going to fix this" == reject.  "I agree, you shouldn't have to fix this" is complete -> accepted
2013-08-16 12:10:49	justinabrahms	ie: checks and balances on rejection

2013-08-16 12:11:38	Yadah	hmm okay I get that, do you think that all the reject options are valid when its a story instead of defect?
2013-08-16 12:11:56	Yadah	for instance
2013-08-16 12:12:14	Yadah	I have the option to Reject -> Can no duplicate a Story item
2013-08-16 12:13:00	justinabrahms	That's a good point.
2013-08-16 12:13:11	justinabrahms	Will you file a story in someday to address that?
2013-08-16 12:13:19	Yadah	word :)
2013-08-16 12:14:56	Yadah	imc-release tag?
2013-08-16 12:15:03	justinabrahms	not for the story
2013-08-16 12:15:10	justinabrahms	imc-release == when those are done, we can push to prod

2013-08-16 13:04:02	jstump	The Space X Grasshopper rocket videos are just mind-blowing from a raw engineering perspective. 
2013-08-16 13:04:32	jstump	A rocket that launches itself sideways, hovers for a bit, and then steers itself vertically back over the launchpad to land again? 
2013-08-16 13:04:41	jstump	Just nuts.
2013-08-16 13:08:46	Yadah	 Is it me or has this year been really exciting in science?
2013-08-16 13:08:56	Yadah	What do you think about Hyperloop?
2013-08-16 13:22:15	jstump	Hyperloop looks deceptively elegant. I'm waiting for more peer review on that one, but I think the initial concept is pretty interesting. 
2013-08-16 13:25:36	Yadah	I think the estimated cost of it is waaaay of
2013-08-16 13:25:37	Yadah	f
2013-08-16 13:26:30	jstump	Maybe. If the tubes really are that simple, it'd be pretty reasonably priced to build.
2013-08-16 13:27:07	Yadah	I guess its one of those things that are so simple its hard to believe for me that is
2013-08-16 13:27:17	jstump	He went out of his way to focus on two key pieces that are critical to low-cost development: 1. The tubes are very, very simple, 2. By going above ground on poles you skip over a TON of costs in digging tunnels or clearing paths. 
2013-08-16 13:27:47	jstump	Oh, I think it could be off as well. $6B gets what? SF to LA? Maybe? Does it count R&D?
2013-08-16 13:28:14	Yadah	Well its open source now so the R&D is me and you now
2013-08-16 13:29:05	jstump	Haha, no, I mean someone has to do materials testing and pilot programs.
2013-08-16 13:29:07	jstump	Those cost money.

2013-08-19 12:16:47	nicholasserra	Okay. For once i'm getting consistent passing on that individual file. The entire suite doesn't run for me though.
2013-08-19 12:17:41	JSON_voorhees	okay, if that test is passing consistently we can merge it as long as its not affecting the other tests

2013-08-19 15:59:08	justinabrahms	oof. bust cache takes a little bit of time now, fwiw.
2013-08-19 15:59:20	justinabrahms	have to npm install all of our dependencies so we have the less module. /cc jstump 
2013-08-19 15:59:40	jstump	But we only have to npm the first time, yes?
2013-08-19 15:59:44	justinabrahms	yes
2013-08-19 15:59:47	jstump	Also, we could add those npm modules to Chef.
2013-08-19 15:59:52	justinabrahms	we could.
2013-08-19 15:59:57	jstump	I think that'd be okay.
2013-08-19 16:00:30	justinabrahms	I really want to have a single place where we define this stuff. Hoping that's one of the things addressed w/ the impending chef improvements.
2013-08-19 16:07:35	jstump	Indeed.
2013-08-19 16:25:58	jstump	"I liked the opinionated nature of the design, but I felt limited as a manager by the inability to group tickets in a flexible way."
2013-08-19 16:26:03	jstump	It's like our tagging feature didn't even exist.
2013-08-19 16:26:49	justinabrahms	onboarding fail.
2013-08-19 16:27:17	justinabrahms	so… IMC is on production! ^_^ http://mlkshk.com/r/SIFU
2013-08-19 16:33:40	jstump	Yeah, we did, but unfortunately doing custom tag searches just wasn't enough. Really what I wanted was the ability to split things easily into multiple projects (e.g. iOS client, Rails, infrastructure, etc), the ability to set multiple milestones for each project, and the ability to see the tickets per-project in chronological groupings.
2013-08-19 16:33:40	jstump	"Flexible" was maybe the wrong term for me to use. I really wanted a bit more structure, even at the expense of flexibility. Tags are nice because they're arbitrary, but viewing sets of tickets by doing tag searches just didn't feel natural.
2013-08-19 16:33:40	jstump	Definitely a cool place to start from, though, and we may revisit the project down the road. Thanks for writing me back!
2013-08-19 16:33:45	jstump	I think he said he wanted initiatives.

2013-08-21 13:10:21	jstump	Why?
2013-08-21 13:10:22	Yadah	is there an "and" missing between functioning - continuous 
2013-08-21 13:10:30	jstump	No, there is not.
2013-08-21 13:10:57	Yadah	I think it reads funny to me because I don't have a good understanding of what it is you are talking about.
2013-08-21 13:11:22	Yadah	When I read it aloud I feel like a pause is missing
2013-08-21 13:12:10	jstump	"continuous integration" is a noun.

2013-08-21 13:30:03	justinabrahms	I find it a little surprising and terrifying that I'm writing the first test that uses sinon to mock out a call to filter_items.json :-/
2013-08-21 13:32:48	nicholasserra	Let's just do this all in python.
2013-08-21 13:33:24	justinabrahms	speaking of things unlikely to happen.. I really want to play around with typescript.

2013-08-21 13:33:59	nicholasserra	lol
2013-08-21 13:35:57	nicholasserra	Is that just another abstraction?
2013-08-21 13:40:59	justinabrahms	its a compile-to-js lang which adds ES6 compatible features as well as optional types for static analysis hints.
2013-08-21 14:05:13	jstump	Am I nuts, or is it completely unprofessional to say, "I'll call you back in 5 minutes. My girlfriend is using my laptop right now." when I ping you for a scheduled call?
2013-08-21 14:05:45	chrisforrette	haha

2013-08-21 14:06:09	chrisforrette	definitely unprofessional
2013-08-21 14:06:16	jstump	It says, "I wasn't really all that interested in this job."
2013-08-21 14:06:25	chrisforrette	maybe a little more tolerable if it was a friend
2013-08-21 14:06:33	chrisforrette	it's an interviewee?

2013-08-21 14:07:12	chrisforrette	you might have to hire him so you can fire him
2013-08-21 14:07:16	chrisforrette	you know, to teach him a lesson
2013-08-21 14:07:57	jstump	Yadah: I don't know! We haven't talked.

2013-08-21 14:31:06	jstump	Youthful exuberance maybe.

2013-08-21 14:35:31	nicholasserra	I'm wondering when I lost my exuberance.

2013-08-22 08:48:07	Yadah	JSON_voorhees: Did you make any changes to the click to copy feature on items?
2013-08-22 09:08:03	nicholasserra	I see that problem too.
2013-08-22 09:08:19	JSON_voorhees	Yadah: we decided to hold off on that for the release
2013-08-22 09:08:30	JSON_voorhees	It is still a bug

2013-08-22 09:45:02	Yadah	nicholasserra: did you try using a yahoo email client?
2013-08-22 09:45:18	Yadah	could be the way they encode email (trying to sound smart)
2013-08-22 09:45:25	Yadah	plus I was using safari 
2013-08-22 09:45:30	JSON_voorhees	Yadah: yes its a regression having to do with a library we upgraded.
2013-08-22 09:45:40	JSON_voorhees	regarding the click to copy bug
2013-08-22 09:47:35	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: l was playing around and it seemed like all the mouseenter events weren't working correctly on the item_card_view

2013-08-22 09:48:19	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: yeah we did a git bisect and it stopped working with jquery-require upgrade
2013-08-22 09:48:58	nicholasserra	I saw some talk about mouseenter not working correctly in the newer Jquery. Weird
2013-08-22 09:51:30	justinabrahms	http://clojurescript.com/
2013-08-22 09:52:41	nicholasserra	Now that one is a little crazy. Clojure and Js are so different.
2013-08-22 09:54:35	nicholasserra	Yadah: Can you check if yahoo mail has an actual "show original" button on the message?
2013-08-22 09:54:56	nicholasserra	I need a raw dump of the entire message, which includes all the headers
2013-08-22 09:55:30	Yadah	Sorry I was laughing at "raw dump"
2013-08-22 09:55:35	Yadah	let me check
2013-08-22 09:55:35	nicholasserra	Lol
2013-08-22 09:55:41	nicholasserra	Gmail calls it "show original"
2013-08-22 09:56:24	Yadah	what if i forward the email to you will that work
2013-08-22 09:57:16	nicholasserra	That might work
2013-08-22 09:57:48	Yadah	done... let me search the web for that ability on yahoo
2013-08-22 09:59:11	Yadah	nicholasserra: are you by chance looking for header info?
2013-08-22 09:59:48	nicholasserra	No, I just wanted to see exactly what the body of the message was.
2013-08-22 10:00:38	Yadah	hmm that second email was the only extra info I could get from the system
2013-08-22 10:04:55	nicholasserra	Yadah: Did the items all show up correctly?
2013-08-22 10:05:11	Yadah	yes just not the tags

2013-08-22 10:25:19	justinabrahms	QSB?
2013-08-22 10:25:38	justinabrahms	also, we load IMC on all pages, iirc
2013-08-22 10:25:53	justinabrahms	also, the networking tab will tell you..

2013-08-22 10:27:10	justinabrahms	click around on that popup to goto the call site
2013-08-22 10:28:54	jstump	I hope the IMC doesn't wait to finish loading before the permalink loads.
2013-08-22 10:29:08	justinabrahms	I don't know that it waits, just that it loads.
2013-08-22 10:30:14	justinabrahms	and it looks like it loads the items while the app is in the loading screen.
2013-08-22 10:31:03	justinabrahms	also, all of those requests for IMC are issued in serial, which is lame.
2013-08-22 10:31:27	justinabrahms	http://i.imgur.com/OBFUYkR.png
2013-08-22 10:34:29	jstump	Agreed.

2013-08-22 10:40:22	chrisforrette	i've got a lot of work to do
2013-08-22 11:15:59	Yadah	justinabrahms: is editing items still broken? I am trying to reassign an item to someone and its not working
2013-08-22 11:16:39	justinabrahms	yes
2013-08-22 11:16:42	justinabrahms	working on it.
2013-08-22 11:16:48	justinabrahms	build is broken, so I can't deploy a fix.

2013-08-22 11:33:23	justinabrahms	Yadah: might be a caching bug?
2013-08-22 11:33:44	justinabrahms	going to your items page, you should be able to search by item number using browser's thing.
2013-08-22 11:34:00	Yadah	Yeah I can find it like that
2013-08-22 11:34:13	Yadah	I had the filter on for "mine" and didn't see it

2013-08-22 13:39:45	jstump	Welp.
2013-08-22 13:39:51	jstump	nicholasserra: FE caching bug exists on staging.
2013-08-22 13:39:57	jstump	nicholasserra: With item moving.
2013-08-22 13:40:56	jstump	nicholasserra: http://glui.me/?i=hls9uooaqbrom4c/2013-08-22_at_1.40_PM.png/
2013-08-22 13:42:27	nicholasserra	Ugh. Local storage reset? What the basic auth username pass for staging?
2013-08-22 13:42:28	jstump	nicholasserra: Another one http://glui.me/?i=hls9uooaqbrom4c/2013-08-22_at_1.40_PM.png/
2013-08-22 13:42:58	jstump	nicholasserra: We can't have every user clear their local storage before using this feature.
2013-08-22 13:43:24	jstump	JSON_voorhees: Do we use key prefixes on local storage? Can we flush it remotely after a deploy?
2013-08-22 13:45:16	nicholasserra	That IMC remove is as basic as it can get. It's just "ItemMasterCollection.getInstance().removeByItemNumber()". I'm trying it now.
2013-08-22 13:47:22	jstump	https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk/status/370545257223446528
2013-08-22 13:47:31	jstump	nicholasserra:  I IMd you more details.
2013-08-22 13:47:44	jstump	nicholasserra: I don't know why it's not removed. I'm happy to share over Skype if you want to co-debug.
2013-08-22 13:48:51	nicholasserra	jstump: Got it, i'm in it now. It's gotta be a memcache issue.
2013-08-22 13:49:15	nicholasserra	jstump: Did it at least disappear from the column when you moved it?
2013-08-22 13:49:15	jstump	nicholasserra: Uhhhh
2013-08-22 13:49:21	jstump	nicholasserra:  Yes.
2013-08-22 13:49:26	jstump	Back on refresh. Won't go away.
2013-08-22 13:49:43	nicholasserra	Okay, so the FE is working correctly. The ItemQuery class has a lot of caching in it that might be the culprit.
2013-08-22 13:50:08	jstump	Why would moving an item not cause the cache to flush, but all other item manipulations do?
2013-08-22 13:51:21	nicholasserra	Those signals for item save might be resetting those cache keys on a condition instead of every time.
2013-08-22 13:51:34	JSON_voorhees	jstump: yeah I'll send u a link hold up
2013-08-22 13:52:50	jstump	nicholasserra: I doubt it, but I guess it's worth a look.

2013-08-22 13:55:27	nicholasserra	jstump: I just don't think it's a FE issue anymore since you cleared everything out. It's coming back from the backend, but ItemQueryBase is definitely filtering any read only out. So that's why i'm leaning towards cache tossing it back in.
2013-08-22 13:56:15	jstump	I look forward to seeing how this is possible. :)
2013-08-22 13:56:24	jstump	Until then, can you comment that feature out of the template?
2013-08-22 13:56:28	jstump	So we're not blocking deploys with a broken feature.
2013-08-22 13:57:44	nicholasserra	Yes.

2013-08-26 10:59:45	chrisforrette	do you use layer comps?
2013-08-26 10:59:49	grantgarrett	the .psd might be a little hard to navigate… it's pretty modular...

2013-08-26 11:00:00	grantgarrett	I find them to be more hassle 
2013-08-26 11:00:18	chrisforrette	ok
2013-08-26 11:01:06	chrisforrette	ill hit you up if i run into any questions
2013-08-26 11:03:50	grantgarrett	chrisforrette: here the ticket: https://sprint.ly/product/1/#!/item/4801
2013-08-26 11:04:11	chrisforrette	ah thanks
2013-08-26 11:25:41	jstump	Due to the terrible UX of AngelList, I didn't realized we'd closed $200k that we had.
2013-08-26 11:25:49	jstump	So we're 71% done with the first raise.
2013-08-26 11:26:40	chrisforrette	nice
2013-08-26 11:27:02	chrisforrette	normally the notifications i miss are like 
2013-08-26 11:27:10	chrisforrette	"someone commented on whatever"
2013-08-26 11:27:16	chrisforrette	not "you have $200K now"
2013-08-26 11:31:00	nicholasserra	O_o
2013-08-26 11:38:30	justinabrahms	jstump: looks like caliper / raven / requirejs additions broke the build? http://ci.sprint.ly/job/sprint.ly/2177/
2013-08-26 11:38:44	justinabrahms	Thankfully, It provides an amazing stacktrace so it should be easy to track down.
2013-08-26 11:41:40	jstump	justinabrahms: Sorry about that. :(
2013-08-26 11:41:49	justinabrahms	no worries.
2013-08-26 11:42:01	justinabrahms	per-branch CI builds will be magical though.
2013-08-26 11:42:24	jstump	Agreed.
2013-08-26 11:42:49	justinabrahms	gerrit does a similar thing, except a bot manages the merge.
2013-08-26 11:43:09	justinabrahms	You have to get 2 +1's for something to merge, one comes from the CI server, another comes from a code reviewer
2013-08-26 11:55:22	jstump	I think we'll need to move to Gerrit for this at some point. I find PRs lacking.
2013-08-26 12:01:35	wookiehangover	jstump: so I found out what's going with sourcemaps.... there's a setting, `useSourceUrl: true` that should be turned off in the Gruntfile. I'm currently in the middle of re-doing require.js stuff once and for all to eliminate duplicate configs, build weirdness, etc
2013-08-26 12:01:57	wookiehangover	and yes, I'm about to Charlie Manson the frontend tooling
2013-08-26 12:02:51	jstump	wookiehangover: Good to hear. Hoping sourcemaps will be fixed up as part of this.
2013-08-26 12:03:20	wookiehangover	that's my primary goal ATM
2013-08-26 12:04:00	jstump	Awesome.

2013-08-26 15:08:22	wookiehangover	js assets are gzipped in production, right?
2013-08-26 15:13:02	chrisforrette	wookiehangover: actually they don't appear to be...
2013-08-26 15:16:55	wookiehangover	chrisforrette: actually nvm, they are https://www.monosnap.com/image/lwVR5bJeRVox0b6qJFI1CU2NI
2013-08-26 15:18:20	chrisforrette	wookiehangover: oh ok
2013-08-26 15:18:41	chrisforrette	i tried a curl request to https://d105717d5kjoy6.cloudfront.net/c4564d7c728c/static/build/js-sp/jquery-require.js and it doesn't have the Content-Encoding header
2013-08-26 15:19:12	wookiehangover	you would have had to request it with an accepts encoding gzip header
2013-08-26 15:19:25	chrisforrette	wookiehangover: ah, good point :)
2013-08-26 15:20:32	wookiehangover	s'all good http://i.gif.ly/d9574e3d.gif
2013-08-26 15:22:27	wookiehangover	so I've re-combobulated things such that the app can be loaded as a single file post-optimization, it's just a honking big file sans gzip
2013-08-26 15:22:38	wookiehangover	but eerily small when gzipped and minified
2013-08-26 15:22:49	wookiehangover	~350kb
2013-08-26 15:31:21	justinabrahms	https://sprint.ly/account/login/ -- pricing info there should probably change somehow
2013-08-26 15:34:00	chrisforrette	nice
2013-08-26 15:45:15	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: is there any type of production/development flag that I could check in the backbone.html template to have branching logic for loading js for dev or prod? would the DEBUG flag do the trick?
2013-08-26 15:45:26	justinabrahms	{{ SPRINTLY_ENV }}
2013-08-26 15:45:37	justinabrahms	development  staging  production   are the values, I think
2013-08-26 15:46:01	justinabrahms	debug is false on staging.
2013-08-26 15:46:05	justinabrahms	not sure how that fits in your plans.
2013-08-26 15:46:34	wookiehangover	so actually, it would probably be helpful if I could talk through this with somebody for a sec
2013-08-26 15:47:34	justinabrahms	happy to help
2013-08-26 15:48:42	chrisforrette	SPRINTLY_ENV in prod is AWS
2013-08-26 15:48:46	chrisforrette	fyi
2013-08-26 15:49:25	wookiehangover	so I've got the app building into a single file, with gzip compression it's definitely small enough to serve the app like that
2013-08-26 15:49:34	wookiehangover	and that will let us use a unified requirejs config for everything
2013-08-26 15:50:12	wookiehangover	but it requires some branching in development... essentially the script tag that loads the app will be different between dev and prod
2013-08-26 15:50:24	wookiehangover	prod would still point to the cdn
2013-08-26 15:50:45	justinabrahms	As long as staging is the same as prod, I'm fine with that.
2013-08-26 15:50:48	wookiehangover	and in dev requirejs would load the app in much the same way it loads now
2013-08-26 15:51:09	wookiehangover	so my question is, what does JS_PATH look like in staging?
2013-08-26 15:51:50	justinabrahms	not sure what JS_PATH is.
2013-08-26 15:51:55	justinabrahms	define(`__CDN_URL__', `https://d3kfd7h85zvrea.cloudfront.net')  -- that's from the staging m4 file
2013-08-26 15:52:08	wookiehangover	ok, that answers it
2013-08-26 15:52:09	justinabrahms	so it should load like prod, but pointed at a different CDN endpoint
2013-08-26 15:52:16	wookiehangover	got it
2013-08-26 15:54:11	wookiehangover	this also updates jquery, eliminates the craziness of "common.js"

2013-08-26 16:05:29	chrisforrette	on my local when I go into 'Mine', and then change to another tab (e.g. from Underday to Triage), it seems to remove the filter of stuff assigned to me—anyone else experiencing this? 
2013-08-26 16:05:50	justinabrahms	its a bug, filed in 5332, I think.
2013-08-26 16:06:06	chrisforrette	justinabrahms: ah, thanks
2013-08-26 16:09:38	Yadah	justinabrahms: Hey can we deploy that fix that Chris just put in?
2013-08-26 16:09:47	justinabrahms	as soon as the build is working.
2013-08-26 16:10:10	jstump	Matt thinks we got our final $300k. I'm less certain. Meeting went well.
2013-08-26 16:10:11	Yadah	awesome!
2013-08-26 16:10:24	Yadah	Awesome as well
2013-08-26 16:10:35	jstump	Yadah: We need to get you plugged in on GitHub and CI. :)
2013-08-26 16:10:46	Yadah	does that mean I get a new mac book pro when it all goes down?
2013-08-26 16:10:46	jstump	Yadah: Or we need to get the Deploys API working. :-D
2013-08-26 16:10:56	Yadah	jstump: Honestly you know what
2013-08-26 16:11:14	Yadah	I am getting a little jealous of being in this room and only understanding about 10% of what you guys talk about
2013-08-26 16:11:21	Yadah	I really want to take courses on development
2013-08-26 16:11:27	Yadah	its something I always wanted anyways

2013-08-26 16:11:43	Yadah	I knew that was coming
2013-08-26 16:11:57	justinabrahms	:)
2013-08-26 16:12:02	justinabrahms	Worked for my wife. :)
2013-08-26 16:12:21	Yadah	Hey you know what I wanted to make?
2013-08-26 16:12:29	justinabrahms	?
2013-08-26 16:12:34	Yadah	I wanted to make a tool that would tell me and the team exactly what when in the build
2013-08-26 16:12:49	Yadah	so that way I could write up small messages about it to the customers
2013-08-26 16:12:55	jstump	Yadah: We have a Deploys API that's built up for this.
2013-08-26 16:13:09	jstump	Yadah: We just need to plug it into our Debian package/deploy scripts.
2013-08-26 16:13:21	jstump	Yadah: It emails you when a developer has deployed your ticket to a given environment.
2013-08-26 16:13:55	Yadah	I would want all tickets that were deployed
2013-08-26 16:14:27	chrisforrette	i like that
2013-08-26 16:15:48	Yadah	jstump: If the API was plugged in would it have that ability? If so I would like to try my hand at making the code or what not that would ask for that report
2013-08-26 16:16:39	justinabrahms	that's a difficult first programming task, but the API is at http://help.sprint.ly/knowledgebase/articles/138392-deploys
2013-08-26 16:16:56	Yadah	So start out with hello world?
2013-08-26 16:16:57	Yadah	lol
2013-08-26 16:17:48	jstump	Yadah: Every single developer in this chatroom started out with "Hello world".
2013-08-26 16:17:55	jstump	It's where you go from there that matters. :)
2013-08-26 16:18:46	Yadah	Okay so which language would be most beneficial or which one would give me the opp to actually work on something sprint.ly related?
2013-08-26 16:18:46	justinabrahms	http://mlkshk.com/r/BLUQ.jpg
2013-08-26 16:18:49	chrisforrette	i didn't go very far
2013-08-26 16:18:56	justinabrahms	Yadah: javascript
2013-08-26 16:18:58	justinabrahms	or python
2013-08-26 16:19:15	justinabrahms	javascript will let you do more web-browser-y things like chrome extensions.
2013-08-26 16:19:19	justinabrahms	python will let you do server-y things.
2013-08-26 16:19:27	justinabrahms	(javascript can also, technically, do server-y things)
2013-08-26 16:19:49	Yadah	isn't Javascript what is used to develop for Android?
2013-08-26 16:19:56	justinabrahms	no, that's Java.
2013-08-26 16:20:03	Yadah	ok
2013-08-26 16:20:16	jstump	Haha, well, the answer is "depends", but let's not go down that rabbit hole. ;)
2013-08-26 16:20:32	Yadah	Yeah keep it light don't scare me away :)
2013-08-26 16:20:39	justinabrahms	If you learn html/css/javascript.. you could put that on a phone.
2013-08-26 16:21:30	Yadah	hmm this could be fun :)
2013-08-26 16:23:22	Yadah	jstump: did you get something setup for Captivate Conference?
2013-08-26 16:33:45	jstump	Yadah: No, I think I'm waiting to hear back.
2013-08-26 16:34:03	Yadah	Okay I will yell at them
2013-08-26 16:34:14	Yadah	jstump: Did you guys end up passing on Lee?
2013-08-26 16:41:57	Yadah	justinabrahms: let me know when the deploy goes live I have a sprinter looking for that bug to be fixed
2013-08-26 16:41:59	jstump	Yadah: justinabrahms did the tech interview. I don't think it went super well. I'll be following up soon (traveling today).
2013-08-26 16:42:08	jstump	Yadah: Please let me followup though. :)
2013-08-26 16:42:46	jstump	Yadah: It also appears he's looking for a position that we weren't looking for so I think part of it can be chalked up to a miscommunication on my part about what we were looking for.

2013-08-26 19:01:35	Yadah	I am confused, I thought Nick was working on that??
2013-08-26 19:02:13	nicholasserra	Fix is merged.

2013-08-26 19:03:59	Yadah	We don't have a test protocol do we?
2013-08-26 19:04:17	JSON_voorhees	Yadah: we have testing suites
2013-08-26 19:04:19	jstump	JSON_voorhees: Can you handle deploy? I might have to board soon.
2013-08-26 19:04:31	jstump	Yadah: We have a pretty massive test suite, but not enough coverage sadly. 
2013-08-26 19:04:31	JSON_voorhees	jstump: sure thing
2013-08-26 19:04:55	jstump	nicholasserra: You got an OpsCode username?
2013-08-26 19:04:56	nicholasserra	jstump: Do you just wanna get me up to speed with deployment another time?
2013-08-26 19:05:00	nicholasserra	Yes, nicholasserra
2013-08-26 19:05:12	nicholasserra	What are the AWS keys in the overrides? 
2013-08-26 19:05:32	jstump	nicholasserra: Whatever your IAM ones are.
2013-08-26 19:05:41	nicholasserra	Okay, so for my personal aws account?
2013-08-26 19:06:03	nicholasserra	I don't think I have access to any sprint.ly aws stuff.
2013-08-26 19:06:21	nicholasserra	Admitting my noob status with opscode right now.
2013-08-26 19:06:54	jstump	No, not personal. Whose AWS key/secret did you use in your Sprint.ly overrides.m4?
2013-08-26 19:07:58	nicholasserra	I'm not running off of any kind of sprint.ly aws stuff. I don't think at the time I started there were any fab helper commands, etc that required it.
2013-08-26 19:08:29	jstump	How are you SQS queues running? haha
2013-08-26 19:09:17	nicholasserra	Haha, i'm either running off of a virtualbox rabbit my queue for dev or switching over to my own person SQS instances when I want to test out celery issues. :P

2013-08-26 19:11:03	jstump	nicholasserra: I need you to create an SSH key and name it id_rsa_sprintly.
2013-08-26 19:11:08	jstump	nicholasserra: And send me the pubkey.
2013-08-26 19:11:28	jstump	nicholasserra: I then need you to go to opscode.com and sign up for an account and send me the username (if you don't already have one).
2013-08-26 19:12:15	nicholasserra	Will do. My opscode username is "nicholasserra"
2013-08-26 19:13:37	jstump	nicholasserra: I've invited you to our OpsCode setup.
2013-08-26 19:13:49	jstump	nicholasserra: Update your overrides.m4 (in both repos!) to use your new AWS key/secret.
2013-08-26 19:23:45	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: is that deploy still going?

2013-08-26 19:26:52	jstump	nicholasserra: You should be able to just do `ssh app17.sprint.ly` to verify.
2013-08-26 19:27:01	jstump	nicholasserra: To verify your Chef setup, run `knife role list`.
2013-08-26 19:27:15	jstump	nicholasserra: You'll need to install both Chef and the knife-ec2 package.

2013-08-27 11:11:44	jstump	JSON_voorhees: We should make a FAQ Django application for that part at some point so Donald can edit them via the admin site. 
2013-08-27 11:14:56	jstump	nicholasserra: I heard you were the one that broke the functional tests login.
2013-08-27 11:15:14	jstump	nicholasserra: I'm adding the functional tests to CI today so we should get that fixed.
2013-08-27 11:15:37	justinabrahms	https://github.com/howiworkdaily/django-faq
2013-08-27 11:16:32	justinabrahms	that said.. should it maybe be in uservoice instead of the django admin?
2013-08-27 11:18:41	nicholasserra	jstump: Nope, I don't have any changes in login. But they never really worked well for me with the chrome driver.
2013-08-27 11:18:58	jstump	Well, we need to fix it. Otherwise we won't be able to deploy.
2013-08-27 11:19:16	jstump	I'll let you and JSON_voorhees duke it out over who fixes the login, but it does need fixing. 
2013-08-27 11:19:27	jstump	It used to be the only test that ran consistently. 
2013-08-27 11:19:36	nicholasserra	Okay. What's wrong with it? Do you mean the login action?
2013-08-27 11:19:49	jstump	  Functional Test Bootstrap

2013-08-27 11:20:04	chrisforrette	jstump & JSON_voorhees: I was thinking some kind of 'marketing' Django app probably makes a lot of sense, and we could put the integrations and videos pages into it too—what ya'll think?
2013-08-27 11:20:46	nicholasserra	Ah, yeah. That runs like 25% of the time for me. I do have a fix for it that does some additional checking in a PR. That might make it more consistent. I'll interface with JSON_voorhees in a bit. Maybe skype him because the functional tests are kind of all over the place for me.
2013-08-27 11:20:53	chrisforrette	JSON_voorhees: PS, I've already done the nav/footer in that FAQ page in the integrations page

2013-08-27 11:42:22	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: we can pair on the functional tests sometime this week, I'd rather avoid skype if possible but whatevs
2013-08-27 11:44:31	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: Okay. We'll have to see what CI complains about and go from there. My stuff has been pretty isolated so far. 
2013-08-27 11:45:03	justinabrahms	I'd dig on pairing on functional test stuff from an architectural standpoint.

2013-08-27 12:31:44	Yadah_	So his browser is a little out of date
2013-08-27 12:31:53	justinabrahms	unlikely to matter
2013-08-27 12:32:06	justinabrahms	if I had to guess, it's an issue with our data binding w/ rivets
2013-08-27 12:32:20	justinabrahms	otherwise, it doesn't make sense why some of the changes would come through and others wouldn't.
2013-08-27 12:32:44	 *	Yadah_ is resisting urge to say use nuts and bolts instead of rivets

2013-08-27 12:33:27	justinabrahms	nice!
2013-08-27 12:33:54	justinabrahms	That's how my wife started ~1 year ago and she's now a Jr. programmer at a local company.
2013-08-27 12:34:17	Yadah_	I just want the extra knowledge and to build some tools for here
2013-08-27 12:34:38	justinabrahms	totally.
2013-08-27 12:35:01	justinabrahms	like being able to write clearly, programming is a weird super-power when you're around people who can't do it.
2013-08-27 12:38:15	Yadah_	okay here is a little interesting thing
2013-08-27 12:38:44	Yadah_	I can't find the bug I entered in that I know had the word 'Nobody' in some of the fields
2013-08-27 12:38:59	Yadah_	I have just tried searching for just that word and nothing comes up
2013-08-27 12:39:19	Yadah_	This would happen if the bug is marked accepted or does it still remain searchable?

2013-08-27 14:13:23	justinabrahms	I'd be willing to help out w/ that
2013-08-27 14:14:07	justinabrahms	I'd write a little backend service which will serve up data, if that's of interest.
2013-08-27 14:14:28	justinabrahms	I need to write a little sprint.ly API client for when I start doing the sync server

2013-08-27 14:36:15	justinabrahms	yo.
2013-08-27 14:36:51	justinabrahms	so… the branch doesn't work for me in prod-like settings
2013-08-27 14:37:09	justinabrahms	where prod-like means __DEBUG_JS__ is off, which means it should load from a single file.
2013-08-27 14:38:21	chrisforrette	JSON_voorhees: you ever have any issues with setting a LESS var in one file and using it in another?
2013-08-27 14:38:32	chrisforrette	I'm getting an undefined error but I've totally done this before
2013-08-27 14:40:38	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: ok, so this is probably just tweaking which script tag gets loaded with the correct path
2013-08-27 14:41:44	wookiehangover	so I used SPRINTLY_ENV == 'DEVELOPMENT' to load the dev js, so if ENV is development and DEBUG_JS is false, it should still be loading the development js
2013-08-27 14:42:50	justinabrahms	ahh. I'd use the DEBUG_JS flag instead of the SPRINTLY_ENV
2013-08-27 14:43:06	justinabrahms	seems like that's the whole purpose of that flag.
2013-08-27 14:43:11	justinabrahms	s/flag/setting/
2013-08-27 14:43:17	wookiehangover	gotcha
2013-08-27 14:43:34	wookiehangover	I didn't know about DEBUG_JS >_<
2013-08-27 14:43:45	justinabrahms	No worries. It's in python land.
2013-08-27 14:43:53	wookiehangover	thar be dragons
2013-08-27 14:44:17	justinabrahms	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/master/snowbird/settings.py.m4#L229
2013-08-27 14:44:46	justinabrahms	so JS_PATH is path/to/cdn/or/local/server + '/js-sp' or '/build/js-sp' depending.
2013-08-27 14:52:15	justinabrahms	if I update it to use DEBUG_JS (and also DEBUG_CSS), then I get the error: `Uncaught Error: undefined missing sprintly/views/main/wasatch_product_index_view ` from almond.js
2013-08-27 14:52:44	JSON_voorhees	chrisforrette: ima take a look
2013-08-27 14:53:58	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: interesting, I don't get that error
2013-08-27 14:55:00	wookiehangover	is that view ever required by anything?
2013-08-27 14:56:39	justinabrahms	it's the homepage.
2013-08-27 15:00:03	wookiehangover	ahh, I thought everything was going through application_controller
2013-08-27 15:00:24	wookiehangover	so the homepage view, whereever its getting called from, just needs to be added to the build
2013-08-27 15:00:54	justinabrahms	I don't see where this is even added..
2013-08-27 15:02:03	wookiehangover	me neither
2013-08-27 15:02:22	wookiehangover	I'm unsure how this was working before
2013-08-27 15:03:10	Yadah_	aye
2013-08-27 15:03:20	justinabrahms	well.. luckily, the javascript is minified for debugging so I'm sure the problem is on this line of code. Just need to figure out the column..
2013-08-27 15:03:52	Yadah_	Has anyone seen the Mine View bug where you set the filter Mine from the dashboard and then you select a different column like Underway vs Pending
2013-08-27 15:03:57	Yadah_	and the filter fails
2013-08-27 15:04:00	justinabrahms	yes
2013-08-27 15:04:02	justinabrahms	it's logged
2013-08-27 15:04:03	jstump	Yadah_: Yes.
2013-08-27 15:04:06	justinabrahms	5332, I think
2013-08-27 15:04:09	Yadah_	ok
2013-08-27 15:05:05	justinabrahms	wookiehangover: application_controller:187
2013-08-27 15:05:43	justinabrahms	dynamic requireing stuff is likely the cause?
2013-08-27 15:05:45	JSON_voorhees	chrisforrette: it looks like I only got through the colors and started on type.less but here ya go https://gist.github.com/meandavejustice/a2f116495af2459c3e78
2013-08-27 15:06:25	chrisforrette	JSON_voorhees: cool, thanks
2013-08-27 15:06:38	wookiehangover	justinabrahms: so yes, that view just needs to be added around line 35
2013-08-27 15:06:46	chrisforrette	you putting these types of files under less/general/?
2013-08-27 15:06:53	wookiehangover	I just thought I had found all the dynamicly loaded modules
2013-08-27 15:06:56	wookiehangover	I guess not
2013-08-27 15:08:12	justinabrahms	cool. seems to work now. :)
2013-08-27 15:09:02	wookiehangover	awesome... I'm still at a loss as to how that view is getting loading, but oh well
2013-08-27 15:09:14	wookiehangover	I'm about to get on a plane, will be back online later on this evening!
2013-08-27 15:09:23	justinabrahms	cool. I'll figure out how, then post back to the thread.
2013-08-27 15:09:57	wookiehangover	thanks for all the review on this pull

2013-08-28 09:22:14	justinabrahms	Will need to investigate how to get them working in chrome.
2013-08-28 09:22:51	justinabrahms	might spend a bit of time today rewriting one of those tests to see if I can get it to pass.
2013-08-28 09:25:22	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: Which version of firefox are you testing with? I know that the mouse moveTo doesn't work in some versions of selenium in FF.
2013-08-28 09:25:29	nicholasserra	I was running into that issue.
2013-08-28 09:26:19	nicholasserra	But  yeah, firefox seems rock solid with everything else. Chrome just tends to throw a ton of StaleElement references.

2013-08-28 11:39:35	justinabrahms	I was making an attempt at that in js land. Control flow issues made that difficult.
2013-08-28 11:40:08	justinabrahms	I can't remember if you were working on functional testing stuff, but I'd like to move them to Python.

2013-08-28 11:41:22	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: That is beautiful.
2013-08-28 11:41:42	nicholasserra	But if its using the underlying selenium package will it be any more consistent in chrome?
2013-08-28 11:41:56	justinabrahms	I need to figure that out.
2013-08-28 11:42:03	justinabrahms	but I think this, as it stands, is a net-win.
2013-08-28 11:42:23	justinabrahms	I have lastpass installed which means my chrome is basically unable to do selenium tests.
2013-08-28 11:43:53	nicholasserra	The python implementation definitely seems cleaner. But the root of the issues we're having are probably with selenium itself. But maybe not, maybe node just hates us. 
2013-08-28 11:44:27	justinabrahms	some of those issues (errors evaluating javascript) was fixed in later versions of selenium.
2013-08-28 11:45:02	nicholasserra	Did you merge your fixes for the functional tests in node? Maybe after that's in we can reevaluate.
2013-08-28 11:46:04	justinabrahms	I haven't merged. Most of the "fixes" are actually just commenting out the broken suites.
2013-08-28 11:46:33	justinabrahms	I attempted to write something page-object-esque in node, but the async nature of it makes things very difficult.
2013-08-28 11:48:48	nicholasserra	Yeah. That's probably another reason we're having consistency problems. 
2013-08-28 11:49:10	nicholasserra	I can switch over to your branch and port over a couple of the larger tests and see if I have more success on the python side.
2013-08-28 11:49:22	nicholasserra	Might be worth it before we get too deep into the node version.
2013-08-28 11:49:40	justinabrahms	that would be great.
2013-08-28 11:49:56	nicholasserra	I'll keep ya posted.
2013-08-28 11:50:04	justinabrahms	when the result of clicking a link is deterministic (ie: not login b/c it can go to product list or dashboard).. it'd be swell if those returned other page objects.

2013-08-28 12:15:45	jstump	Yadah_: justinabrahms and I have lost a bunch of weight so if you want to bounce ideas around let us know. 
2013-08-28 12:30:17	Yadah_	yeah its been a rid. Sadly my wife has not seen the same amount of loss, she has issues with her thyroid that we need to address
2013-08-28 12:34:04	jstump	Yadah_: Women have less muscle mass as well, which can make losing fat rapidly more difficult. 
2013-08-28 12:35:52	Yadah_	jstump: Yup we have looked into that as well but she exhibits several issues that point to thyroid. Thinning hair, ridge nails, fatigue, weight swings. And we have a pretty good bead on her caloric intake, so we know she is not cramming the body full of to much food
2013-08-28 12:39:17	jstump	Yadah_: Sure. I wasn't questioning. Just saying even with that fixed her weight loss won't track your own. :)

2013-08-28 13:26:05	justinabrahms	I would focus on getting them running in firefox for right now.
2013-08-28 13:26:33	justinabrahms	The liklihood we'll run into cross-browser js bugs is low compared to the number of all-browser bugs we're not catching b/c we don't have functional coverage.

2013-08-28 14:26:41	jstump	I watched the whole video and missed the supposedly controversial twerking. Twice.
2013-08-28 14:26:47	Yadah_	whew the first link I thought was a nerd joke that I didn't get
2013-08-28 14:26:57	jstump	Clearly the average American's norms are much different than my own. 
2013-08-28 14:27:20	jstump	If a pop star doing what pop stars do is controversial, the terrorists have won.
2013-08-28 14:27:24	Yadah_	Or you are an adult and you know that MTV has been about sex since it stop showing music and knew that something sexy would be shown
2013-08-28 14:27:58	Yadah_	thats the way I see it
2013-08-28 14:28:24	jstump	I found Madonna nearly committing lesbian statutory assault on stage to be a wee bit more controversial. Fuck, Fart Man was more controversial than this. 
2013-08-28 14:28:47	Yadah_	Not to mention I LOVE how she fired back at people on twitter say that she is getting more tweets a minute than the super bowl black out. 
2013-08-28 14:28:51	Yadah_	EXACTLY
2013-08-28 14:29:01	jstump	I'm honestly not sure if I hate her tongue sticking out the whole time more or less than I did seeing an old dude's naked ass on stage in a spandex suit. 
2013-08-28 14:29:22	Yadah_	lol
2013-08-28 14:29:22	jstump	Side note: Fart Man was fucking classic. 
2013-08-28 14:29:35	Yadah_	My only knock on her performance
2013-08-28 14:29:51	Yadah_	was that she was doing a dance that by its very nature requires a large butt... 
2013-08-28 14:29:54	Yadah_	She has no butt
2013-08-28 14:30:42	jstump	Yadah_: Never mind that she was wearing a tight latex outfit. I've been under the impression that a proper twerk requires butt mass, as you point out, and some fluidity in attire. 
2013-08-28 14:31:05	Yadah_	This is also true.
2013-08-28 14:31:17	Yadah_	I was hearing people complain that their kids watched it. 
2013-08-28 14:31:21	jstump	I've seen proper twerking in a few videos and whatever the fuck she was doing was a 1-2 on a 10 point twerking scale. 
2013-08-28 14:31:58	Yadah_	I knew what I was getting my child into when I took her to a bruno mars concert. I was prepared to explain any questions that she had. You have to be a numbskull to watch ANYTHING on MTV with a kid thinking it will be kid safe

2013-08-28 15:16:45	jasonrehmus	thx Joe
2013-08-28 15:25:19	chrisforrette	i just used the ladies' bathroom after a woman very obviously dropped a deuce, peed, came out and then another lady immediately went in after me
2013-08-28 15:25:28	chrisforrette	she's going to think I'm a big stinky asshole

2013-08-28 16:55:32	matt1	@joe hi
2013-08-28 16:56:07	jstump	Uh oh.
2013-08-28 16:56:11	jstump	The boss has arrived.
2013-08-28 16:56:13	jstump	;)
2013-08-28 16:56:56	matt1	:)
2013-08-28 16:56:57	Yadah_	A wild Matt has appeared!
2013-08-28 16:58:03	matt1	could we just bake our own IRC client inside of the sprintly app?
2013-08-28 17:00:46	justinabrahms	matt1: yes.
2013-08-28 17:01:06	justinabrahms	In fact, that's what I was planning while we've been talking about "chat in the app"
2013-08-28 17:01:38	matt1	that would be cool and very coder-friendly
2013-08-28 17:01:40	jstump	We should / could partner with the Grove.
2013-08-28 17:01:51	matt1	don't know what that is
2013-08-28 17:01:55	justinabrahms	grove.io
2013-08-28 17:02:32	Yadah_	Oh and they have an iphone client as well
2013-08-28 17:02:37	jstump	"About 40 percent of the highest-paid CEOs in the United States over the past 20 years eventually ended up being fired, paying fraud-related fines or settlements, or accepting government bailout money, according to a study released on Wednesday."
2013-08-28 17:02:50	jstump	The thing I like about the IRC route is hashtags and IRC room names line up perfectly. :)
2013-08-28 17:02:57	matt1	that's why I insist on low pay
2013-08-28 17:03:12	justinabrahms	It's future proof.
2013-08-28 17:08:52	jstump	Epic javascript wtfery:
2013-08-28 17:08:52	jstump	(['10','10','10','10','10'].map(parseInt)) == [10, NaN, 2, 3, 4]
2013-08-28 17:08:52	jstump	Can you tell what's happening?
2013-08-28 17:09:27	justinabrahms	Answer is that map doesn't work that way in javascript.
2013-08-28 17:10:09	jstump	Yeah, or parseInt. 
2013-08-28 17:10:43	justinabrahms	building blocks of the modern internet. Hurray.
2013-08-28 17:18:27	jstump	matt1: Just sent you the new account cohort data. It's from this last Friday's DB dump and should go a full 18 months back (not including Aug).
