2013-11-19 11:48:45	Wraithan	It looks like it is popping down because it is expanding wider than there is space for it

2013-12-23 19:22:00	JSON_voorhees	sorry it took so long, we just found an issue with a pr that was merged earlier in the day and i had to revert it.
2013-12-23 19:22:14	JSON_voorhees	handlebars upgrade screwed us

2013-12-23 19:23:01	Wraithan	My clients were also hitting the bug and they were pinging me to see if I could ping folks I knew at sprintly

2014-01-15 16:44:37	Wraithan	not to pick a fight, but pee cookie sheet is fine, but occasional people talking about job openings in the area isn't?
2014-01-15 16:44:56	JSON_voorhees	sure
2014-01-15 16:45:14	JSON_voorhees	That guy is fine to talk about a job
2014-01-15 16:45:34	JSON_voorhees	just don't want that to become a everyday thing is all
2014-01-15 16:46:05	Wraithan	ok
2014-01-15 16:48:06	JSON_voorhees	I'm also not the benevolent dictator of subject matter for irc channels, I just suggested that a job board might be more appropriate
2014-01-15 16:48:46	Wraithan	I just think it is interesting that you'd rather the job postings were else where, but pee cookie sheets, sex planets, etc are totally cool
2014-01-15 16:50:37	JSON_voorhees	absolutely
2014-01-15 16:50:39	Wraithan	I'm not saying any of this as an organizer
2014-01-15 16:53:34	JSON_voorhees	I think you know the difference between people making jokes and allowing a precedent of recruiters spamming our irc channel
2014-01-15 16:55:05	Wraithan	rick_at_nwea is in more than one channel that you are in, is friends with or works at UA (can't remember) and wanted to toss out there that a startup was looking for a nodejs dev
2014-01-15 16:55:11	Wraithan	I think that is different than a random recruiter
2014-01-15 16:55:46	JSON_voorhees	like I said before that is fine if that is the case
2014-01-15 16:56:10	JSON_voorhees	It just didn't seem like that the way it was worded
2014-01-15 16:56:25	Wraithan	*shrug* I think recruiters periodically hanging out and tossing job postings out there is totally fine, even if they are just recruiters and not devs
2014-01-15 16:57:23	JSON_voorhees	Many devs get annoyed at that, doesn't particularly bother me either as long as it's not all the time
2014-01-15 16:57:39	JSON_voorhees	I didn't feel like I was being particularly rude to that guy
2014-01-15 17:00:51	Wraithan	Sorry, I looking at this conversation, I'm being a combative asshole. 
2014-01-15 17:01:28	JSON_voorhees	you know I don't take things you say that way :)
2014-01-15 17:01:46	JSON_voorhees	I don't think your an asshole
