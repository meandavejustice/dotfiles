2013-05-17 22:58:30	RobW_	I'm guessing it takes the first true value.
2013-05-17 22:59:08	preaction_	it's just "or". it takes advantage of the return value, and short-circuiting
2013-05-17 22:59:22	preaction_	and yes, the first true value, or the last value
2013-05-17 22:59:24	RobW_	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation
2013-05-17 22:59:31	RobW_	short circuit, thanks
2013-05-17 22:59:45	RobW_	preaction_: Thank you.
2013-05-17 22:59:50	preaction_	short-circuiting is something specific. it is not that entire assignment statement
2013-05-17 23:00:16	preaction_	it says "if the first part is true, i don't even have to look at the second, which might be a function call i have to evaluate." it short-circuits
2013-05-17 23:00:23	RobW_	preaction_: gotcha.

2013-05-18 00:14:39	ashnur	how can that happen? something calls send with null?

It would suck if the player has played from level 1 to 98 and when it's time to load level 99, the server happens to be down. Thus, I need to make sure it "times out" after a while and offer to reload.

2013-05-22 19:05:43	dwcook	Ilhami, first, big red flag: Never delete anything using GET. Try DELETE or possibly POST.

2013-05-22 19:07:27	dwcook	Be clear what you mean.
2013-05-22 19:07:41	zamnuts	Ilhami, since you want a change event to trigger the submission (which is great for the user experience) you must have the FIRST option be a message, e.g. "Select an Article to Delete"
2013-05-22 19:07:43	luigi69	Ilhami being strictly there is no such thing. Javascript can handle events like `someone clicked on a button`, but the button itself is some kind of HTML markup, possibly styled with CSS.
2013-05-22 19:07:55	dwcook	You're saying you can't delete a post. Okay, so is the request going through?
2013-05-22 19:08:06	Ilhami	I can delete a post :)
2013-05-22 19:08:08	dwcook	The button is an *element*
2013-05-22 19:08:10	Ilhami	just not the deault one
2013-05-22 19:08:12	Ilhami	default
2013-05-22 19:08:16	Ilhami	thats why I need a button
2013-05-22 19:08:18	zamnuts	Ilhami, if you want the first entry to be an article title, a submit button is required.
2013-05-22 19:08:24	dwcook	I don't know what a "default post" is.
2013-05-22 19:08:38	Ilhami	the first post which is selected automatically in the dropdown menu

2013-05-22 19:08:59	dwcook	So your problem is that since you only submit on clicking the radio button, you can't choose the first one.

2013-05-22 19:09:10	dwcook	Solution: Don't do that. Just use a submit button.
2013-05-22 19:09:22	zamnuts	Ilhami, it is better practice (on a auto-submitted select) to give an instructional message as the default value.
2013-05-22 19:09:51	Ilhami	I am making a very simple CMS :D
2013-05-22 19:09:57	Ilhami	its kinda hard
2013-05-22 19:10:13	zamnuts	Ilhami, if you go with that approach (first option is a message rather than an article), make sure to check the value of $_GET['id'] before using it (make sure it is not blank of value="")
2013-05-22 19:10:19	dwcook	Frankly it's kind of unexpected that clicking a radio button should submit a form

2013-05-22 19:10:33	Ilhami	its a dropdown menu
2013-05-22 19:10:41	luigi69	Besides it might be a good idea not to learn everything at once. You could for example skip for now javascript enchancements, and dig more about server-side and markup relations.
2013-05-22 19:10:43	dwcook	Fair enough
2013-05-22 19:10:43	Ilhami	not a radio button
2013-05-22 19:10:44	dwcook	same deal though
2013-05-22 19:11:11	zamnuts	dwcook, Ilhami, throwing in a confirmation alert (or similar modal) would help w/ the fat finger
2013-05-22 19:11:21	Ilhami	So javascript and java have a lot of things in common?

2013-05-22 20:52:58	karlpinc	If I write <script type="text/javascript" src="foo" /> <script type="text/javascript>foofunc();</script>  is the "foo" file guarenteed to be evaluated before foofunc() is called?  If not, what's the right way to do this?
2013-05-22 20:53:18	yansanmo	you need a </script> tag for the first

2013-05-22 22:08:47	Havvy	From the PHP fractal page:  "Weak typing (i.e., silent automatic conversion between strings/numbers/et al) is so complex that whatever minor programmer effort is saved is by no means worth it."

2013-05-23 17:59:34	dwcook	Sorella, I think you're right, unless you need to mutate the array somehow; which I would rather not do, naturally, but sometimes it makes sense.
2013-05-23 17:59:50	yansanmo	FailDrain, it's because you don't seem to read what you write, and don't think what you want..

2013-05-23 18:00:42	Sorella	FailDrain, hm, because JavaScript isn't typed and not declarative?

The problem is that the object is of arbitrary hierarchial depth. An array is passed into the edit function, which loads the right object, then opens the editor. The problem is saving the data from the editor back into the *original* object.
2013-05-23 18:09:12	Rafajafar	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/046c93d788a17dbff2a8
2013-05-23 18:09:15	Sorella	Global variables are not a good design decision. Try limiting their scope to the things that'll use them. Create small functions that do only a single thing, and don't work with the outside world, but rather just with the parameters they're given. Then construct your program by mixing and matching (composing) these functions and passing the appropriate values to them.
2013-05-23 18:09:57	dwcook	Rafajafar, if you mutate an object that is the value of a property of some other object, the changes are visible from that other object.

2013-05-23 18:56:01	Sorella	QuasiQuote allows you to write expressions that won't be evaluated by the compiler, just read by the parser. Unquote allows you to selectively evaluate expressions inside a QuasiQuote. UnquoteSplicing is the same as Unquote, but you're taking an expression that returns a List and spreading it around, kind of like MapConcat

2013-05-23 19:25:36	dwcook	Lajjla, he meant something else.
2013-05-23 19:25:40	Lajjla	dwcook, yeah
2013-05-23 19:25:42	Lajjla	scope right?
2013-05-23 19:25:54	dwcook	He just meant that an object literal cannot be defined in terms of its own properties.
2013-05-23 19:26:00	Lajjla	Yeah, scope.
2013-05-23 19:26:08	dwcook	It's not exactly about scope.

2013-05-23 19:26:36	Lajjla	Sure it is. It just means that an object is not available in its own scope.

2013-05-24 10:27:21	dalnet22	I'm trying to figure out if I should use IDs in this situation or not. I'm going to have objects with properties that refer to other objects. For example, the Bus array will have bus objects; and each bus will have an engine, which is an object in the engine array. So you figure bus[0].engine = engine[0]. Then let's say I click on the engine, and I want to know which bus it's attached to.
2013-05-24 10:27:21	dalnet22	So, I'd have to also set engine[0].bus = bus[0]. But then, what if I delete a bus or engine? Wouldn't that mean that I'd have to go through each array and edit each one?

2013-05-24 10:29:13	dalnet22	for example, if I splice bus[0], then that means that bus[1] because bus[0]. But now engine[0].bus is still bus[0], which means it's now attached to what was bus[1]... and so on

2013-05-24 10:30:52	dwcook	dalnet22, I think I've used some sort of id thing in a similar situation
2013-05-24 10:31:00	dwcook	dalnet22, you have two structures: The one that keeps the order, and the one you can look up objects by their id in
2013-05-24 10:31:10	dwcook	Then instead of storing an index, you store an id
2013-05-24 10:31:14	dwcook	Wait
2013-05-24 10:31:20	dalnet22	dwcook that's how I have it now
2013-05-24 10:31:23	dwcook	You also might not need that much
2013-05-24 10:31:31	dwcook	since object values are basically ids themselves

2013-05-24 10:32:21	dwcook	You could probably
2013-05-24 10:32:35	dwcook	When you store an object value in two different places, they access the same object
2013-05-24 10:32:43	dwcook	In effect JS has its own "id store"

2013-05-24 15:03:09	Havvy	So then why is var a statement and not a variable declaration?
2013-05-24 15:03:36	sacho	since hoisting function declarations from some statements would be ambiguous, ecma5 resolves to simply not allow them in statements. Now you have Programs(essentially any scoped block of code), which have SourceElements, and a SourceElement is either a Statement or a FunctionDeclaration

2013-05-24 15:05:48	Havvy	Yeah...that's some nasty semantics there.
2013-05-24 15:06:01	sacho	Havvy, the difference is that multiple var declarations being hoisted would not have an unexpected effect - you still have the assignments in the appropriate places. e.g. if (x) { var foo = 'bar'; } else { var foo = 'baz'; } (since the assignments aren't actually hoisted, hoisting wouldn't notably change the semantics)

2013-05-24 16:28:55	platzhirsch	sacho: my webserver told me the requst was issued and it responded with 200
2013-05-24 16:29:16	Havvy	Ignore me; I'm confused by your statement. Listen to sacho.
2013-05-24 16:29:25	platzhirsch	but I didn't get the log message I placed in the result function

2013-05-24 16:30:36	platzhirsch	I would like to, but not yet. I would have to isolate the code, but I guess I first restructure it maybe this solves the problem anyway. There seems to be a problem with too many anonymous functions
2013-05-24 16:31:05	sacho	You should name them.
2013-05-24 16:31:11	sacho	It'd make your debugging easier, too.

2013-05-24 16:32:10	ckknight	msafi: you don't do that in JS. Instead you can make a timeout using setTimeout that runs a function you provide after a specified amount of time. e.g. setTimeout(function () { console.log("hello"); }, 1000);

2013-05-24 16:49:57	sacho	thedangler, the div is never "cut" in half. Two divs are created on top of it, both having the same content. The left one is only as wide as half the page. The right one's content is shifted to the left(with the left style), so it looks like it starts at half the page. Then the two divs are moved away from each other with a transform.
2013-05-24 16:50:23	sacho	And now that the magic is explained, it's no longer cool.

2013-05-25 11:44:29	ecmabot	Havvy: Confused by why 0.1+0.2 is not 0.3? In base-10 0.1 is simple, but in base-2, it's not. Consider a base-10 system with only three decimal places: 1/3 is represented as 0.333, even though that's imprecise. Add 1/3 to 1/3 and we get 0.666, which isn't exactly 1/6. Add another 1/3 and we get 0.999, which isn't exactly 1. In base-2, 0.1 is hard to represent, but 0.5 is easy. See http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html

2013-06-26 12:59:20	ImBcmDth	lets see...localstorage - allows more data. is slightly more structured. better api. doesn't clog http headers with useless information. doesn't leak info over the wire.
2013-06-26 12:59:28	Sorella	paulkon, if you install an application in your user's computer or something, that user can easily wipe out any file in your application. That doesn't mean using files is bad.

2013-06-26 13:00:14	paulkon	the majority of the data that is stored in redis in relation to the session is primarily metadata used for validation

2013-06-26 19:39:43	dwcook	ashnur, just keep in mind that whenever you notice yourself writing stuff repeatedly, there's probably a way to abstract it with functions.

2013-06-26 19:42:40	ashnur	dwcook: my current issue is that sometimes I find that I write practically the same code, but with slight changes. like i increment or decrement the same variable. or I do the same thing but with a different variable.
2013-06-26 19:43:05	ashnur	that is why learning something like Haskell would be good. i like how they define functions
2013-06-26 19:43:09	dwcook	ashnur, a natural indication of what one of the parameters should be.
2013-06-26 19:43:12	ashnur	i should get used to that thinking
