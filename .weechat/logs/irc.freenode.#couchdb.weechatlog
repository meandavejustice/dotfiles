2013-11-26 15:45:09	+dch	… version?
2013-11-26 15:45:24	terinjokes	squeeze
2013-11-26 15:45:32	terinjokes	i think it's 1.8.0
2013-11-26 15:45:35	+rnewson	dpkg -l |grep mozjs
2013-11-26 15:45:50	terinjokes	1.9.1.16-20
2013-11-26 15:46:02	terinjokes	which i find is not helpful
2013-11-26 15:46:37	+dch	yeah.
2013-11-26 15:46:53	+dch	Um here’s what I would do (knowing nothing of your context BTW).
2013-11-26 15:46:56	terinjokes	trying to see if I could get couchjs to echo something back to me
2013-11-26 15:47:20	+dch	I assume you have a prior problem preceding?
2013-11-26 15:47:58	terinjokes	couchdb installs and runs fine
2013-11-26 15:48:15	terinjokes	but things aren't acting right, especially around regexps
2013-11-26 15:48:20	+dch	terinjokes: then I’m confused about what you want to achieve, wrt to your original question.
2013-11-26 15:49:59	terinjokes	dch: to find out if I'm below the required version, i guess
2013-11-26 15:50:13	+rnewson	terinjokes: there should be a libmozjs185-dev 
2013-11-26 15:50:17	+dch	heh. It shouldn’t install or compile in that case.
2013-11-26 15:50:21	 *	dch touches wood.
2013-11-26 15:51:57	+dch	terinjokes: ok, then there’s a difference between <= 1.8.0rc1 spidermonkey and > than that that screws up Regex.
2013-11-26 15:52:16	terinjokes	rnewson: there's not, that's in wheezy
2013-11-26 15:52:29	+dch	there’s a workaround, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-577

2013-11-26 15:53:30	+dch	do  var rr2 = new RegExp("\n"); rr2.exec("fafdadsds”); instead.
2013-11-26 15:53:49	+dch	terinjokes: had you considered mentioning that first perhaps?
2013-11-26 15:54:02	+dch	so what do you want to do here?
2013-11-26 15:54:41	+dch	there’s a known workaround for that specific issue (fix your ddocs) or we can help you figure out the easiest way to a self-built couchdb with a newer libmozjs

2013-11-27 10:52:42	isaacs	and i need to be an admin to get that?
2013-11-27 10:52:54	+rnewson	anything already written to disk will not be uncompressed/recompressed if you change this config value.
2013-11-27 10:53:19	isaacs	ugh, ok
2013-11-27 10:53:19	+rnewson	it depends on your couchdb setup but usually, yes. If you have an admin at all (and I'm sure you must do), you'll need to be admin to change config.
2013-11-27 10:53:37	isaacs	you have to be an admin to GET config as well, it seems
2013-11-27 10:53:41	isaacs	ok, so, that doesn't really work.
2013-11-27 10:53:54	+rnewson	all this means is that the internal couchdb md5 calc isn't something you can build from.
2013-11-27 10:54:07	+rnewson	do you store checksums yourself? or could you add them?
2013-11-27 10:54:21	isaacs	no, i don't
2013-11-27 10:54:26	isaacs	i store shasums, but that's app-specific
2013-11-27 10:54:36	isaacs	this program can't rely on that.
2013-11-27 10:54:54	isaacs	ie, npm stores shasums, but a) manta doesn't speak shasum, and b) mcouch might be used for more than npm
2013-11-27 10:54:57	+rnewson	the md5's on attachments (and generally within couch) are to detect corruption. It's only recently that we returned Content-MD5 in responses.
2013-11-27 10:55:37	+rnewson	and the only other thing is does is verify non-corruption on PUT (we'll calculate md5 and fail the PUT if it doesn't match the Content-MD5 request header, if present).
2013-11-27 10:55:42	isaacs	so, then, my solution option is "mcouch doesn't work if you've changed your compressible_types config"
2013-11-27 10:55:59	+rnewson	mcouch?
2013-11-27 10:56:02	isaacs	alternatively, "if you have changed your compressible_types, tell mcouch about it, otherwise it'll use the default"
2013-11-27 10:56:08	isaacs	the manta-couch-replicator-thingie

2013-11-27 10:56:22	isaacs	manta has a bunch of cli commands starting with m
2013-11-27 10:56:26	+rnewson	well, as noted, the couchdb replicator doesn't use this to decide what to transfer

2013-11-27 10:56:40	isaacs	but the couchdb replicator stores couchdb-specific data about everything that manta doesn't.
2013-11-27 10:56:58	+rnewson	the couchdb replicator stores nothing, but I think I understand your meaning.
2013-11-27 10:57:18	isaacs	i mean, it's built on the assumption that it's replicating between couches
2013-11-27 10:57:28	isaacs	not from couchdb to some generic file storage thing
2013-11-27 10:57:45	+rnewson	oh, sure. it's assuming a couchdb or couchdb-compatible thing at both ends
2013-11-27 10:58:01	overtime	is there any website that i can download old couchdb? such as 1.2.0 ~ 1.2.1?
2013-11-27 10:58:24	+rnewson	overtime: should be in the asf archives.
2013-11-27 11:00:25	+rnewson	isaacs: are we sure the md5 can't help you? the only time I can think it would go wrong is if you've not copied the bytes verbatim from couchdb to this other store (e.g, if you uncompressed them).

2013-11-27 11:04:29	isaacs	oh, it will, but it won't decompress if you don't accept that

2013-11-27 11:05:49	+rnewson	perhaps the bulk of your problem vanishes in practice.
2013-11-27 11:06:08	isaacs	rnewson: but it's a pretty gnarly caveat for this program i'm writing, if someone wants to use it for not-npm

2013-11-27 11:09:15	+rnewson	that flag we should/could expose. I'm checking to see if we do already via options
2013-11-27 11:09:25	isaacs	rad.
2013-11-27 11:09:34	isaacs	that'd help a lot.
2013-11-27 11:10:46	+rnewson	we do know internally in the #att records, in order to apply decompression or not based on request headers.

2013-11-27 11:13:34	isaacs	this is definitely way better than hard-coding a list of types, and explaining in the readme
2013-11-27 11:13:37	+rnewson	and not retrospective, though we could add it during compaction (rather expensively)
2013-11-27 11:13:50	isaacs	even if it was just for new attachments, that'd be fine.
2013-11-27 11:13:55	+rnewson	it's annoying that couchdb doesn't always have both the md5 and length of compressed and uncompressed form
2013-11-27 11:13:58	isaacs	the nice thing about exponential growth is that the past doesn't matter :)

2013-11-27 11:34:14	isaacs	doesn't really matter to me how manta stores it, exactly
2013-11-27 11:34:19	+rnewson	sure.
2013-11-27 11:34:20	isaacs	as long as it's there when i want it
2013-11-27 11:35:45	isaacs	rnewson: did jan____ or JasonSmith mention off-disk attachments to you at all?
2013-11-27 11:35:56	+rnewson	isaacs: yes.
2013-11-27 11:36:21	isaacs	rnewson: it'd be pretty nice if, as i migrate to storing tarballs in the cdn'ed manta storage thing, if users who dont' have the newest npm client (or who are relying on replication) could still have their stuff work
2013-11-27 11:36:29	+rnewson	I've been an advocate in the past, and written the code at least once, but much less convinced these days. It would depend on the goals, really.
2013-11-27 11:36:38	+jan____	isaacs: did anyone mention rnewson did some research work in that area? :)
2013-11-27 11:36:39	+rnewson	The new failure cases bother me.
2013-11-27 11:37:04	isaacs	jan____: yeah, i think JasonSmith mentioned that.  i didn't know if there was another "bob" on the team, though :)
2013-11-27 11:37:20	+jan____	this is the one :)
2013-11-27 11:37:28	+rnewson	Having the blobs outside of couchdb entirely seems to dilute the value couchdb is bringing to the problem more or less entirely.
2013-11-27 11:37:40	isaacs	rnewson: yeah, of course.  i mean, now you can randomly get 404's, dropped sockets, corrupted data, etc.
2013-11-27 11:37:53	+rnewson	storing atts in a different file to the docs has some upsides, it's far easier to compact the db, for example.
2013-11-27 11:37:54	isaacs	rnewson: well, in npm's case, i mean, it's already pretty much a foregone conclusion.
2013-11-27 11:38:04	+rnewson	but if you lose one file and not the other, you have a really weird state.
2013-11-27 11:38:08	+rnewson	(for a database)
2013-11-27 11:38:14	isaacs	oh,"blobs" = "attachments"?  or data in general?

2013-11-27 11:38:36	+rnewson	oh, sorry. by "blob" I mean couchdb attachments, it's just shorter.
2013-11-27 11:38:40	isaacs	gotcha
2013-11-27 11:39:19	-->	pvde (~pvde@109.130.12.212) has joined #couchdb
2013-11-27 11:39:25	isaacs	i think the bottom line is that there are better places to put attachments than in couchdb.  eg, if you have a million tarballs, and want to unpack them all and look inside them, it's realy hard to do that with couchdb attachments.
2013-11-27 11:39:28	+rnewson	what I've written before is a separate .att file for each .couch file, rooted at a different place, allowing for it to be served from a different disk, but still in the same server
2013-11-27 11:39:35	+rnewson	to minimize just how crazy the failures could be
2013-11-27 11:39:48	isaacs	i dunno.  fs failures are still pretty crazy :)
2013-11-27 11:39:49	+rnewson	but having it as just a url to some CDN requires no couchdb work afaict
2013-11-27 11:39:55	isaacs	but yeah, at that point, couch is probably hurty also.
2013-11-27 11:40:10	+rnewson	sure, but the "it's all one file" has upsides that are lost with any form of 'external' attachments.
2013-11-27 11:40:16	isaacs	rnewson: absolutely.
2013-11-27 11:40:23	+jan____	to be precise: this wouldn’t be individual tarballs on the FS, but one big file with all of them inside

2013-11-27 11:40:32	+rnewson	the cloudant mirror of the npm registry is still a beast, but it's more manageable as it's sharded.
2013-11-27 11:40:48	+rnewson	jan____: sure, but there's also the file-per-attachment approach
2013-11-27 11:40:53	isaacs	otoh, "it's all one file" is only an upside when your couchdb is small enough to do something with that file.
2013-11-27 11:40:55	+rnewson	and a hybrid one based on file size
2013-11-27 11:41:04	+rnewson	trust me that you don't want millions of tiny files either.
2013-11-27 11:41:04	isaacs	npm is a relatively small database, with a huge corpus of attachments.
2013-11-27 11:41:08	+rnewson	*nod*
2013-11-27 11:41:14	+jan____	rnewson: sure, but that multiplies your fears by the number of attachments :0
2013-11-27 11:41:17	+jan____	:)
2013-11-27 11:41:25	+rnewson	yup, making it possible to replicate drove the 1.5.0 replication enhancements.
2013-11-27 11:41:26	+jan____	I’d love if we can make NPM a happy case for CouchDB.
2013-11-27 11:41:30	+rnewson	it's a great test suite
2013-11-27 11:41:32	isaacs	rnewson: what i actually want is millions of tiny files in manta
2013-11-27 11:41:39	+rnewson	isaacs: understood.
2013-11-27 11:41:49	isaacs	where i have the tools to manage them effectively, rename them all, put them behind cdn's, etc.
2013-11-27 11:41:55	+jan____	isaacs: the one big file for all attachments is still great for NPM operationally
2013-11-27 11:42:07	+rnewson	you could add a proxy handler to your couchdb install and adjust the urls you use to fetch attachments.
2013-11-27 11:42:17	+rnewson	that way all your clients still hit the same host:port
2013-11-27 11:42:24	+rnewson	but attachments come from elsewhere, through the box
2013-11-27 11:42:29	isaacs	right

2013-11-27 11:42:55	+rnewson	it would, obviously, stop being possible to replicate the npm registry, as we've done.
2013-11-27 11:43:10	isaacs	well, the replicator would have to be smart about fetching external attachments
2013-11-27 11:43:26	+rnewson	why would it fetch them? isn't the whole point that they're not stored in couchdb?
2013-11-27 11:43:34	isaacs	i mean, your replicator
2013-11-27 11:43:37	+rnewson	Fetch: separately, you might regret that nick.
2013-11-27 11:43:38	isaacs	on your end, if you want them internal
2013-11-27 11:43:46	isaacs	hahah
2013-11-27 11:43:53	isaacs	Fetch: indeed :)
2013-11-27 11:44:20	+rnewson	well, we're back to goals, and the stating-them-clearly part in particular.
2013-11-27 11:44:51	+rnewson	if the goal is to avoid copying the attachments about by moving them outside of the database, I can't reconcile that with the notion that we'd teach the replicator to copy them. Seems one or the other.
2013-11-27 11:45:08	+rnewson	I wrote a bit on this on user@ today or yesterday.
2013-11-27 11:45:32	+rnewson	the two pain points for you are a) it's a huge file on disk and b) the replicator is flaky on large attachments or docs with many attachments.
2013-11-27 11:45:49	+rnewson	sharding is the fix for a and bug fixes for b, though obviously that helps you not a jot today.
2013-11-27 11:46:11	+rnewson	the replicator should be able to resume an attachment replication that fails midway, within reason. It is completely intolerant to that right now.
2013-11-27 11:46:17	isaacs	rnewson: well, "having a smaller file, period" is also a fix for A
2013-11-27 11:46:24	isaacs	rnewson: without attachments the npm registry is not that big;
2013-11-27 11:46:29	+rnewson	sure.
2013-11-27 11:46:44	+rnewson	it's also a fix for B, since the attachments wouldn't be replicated owing to not existing.

2013-11-27 11:48:12	isaacs	(contrived, but not that much)
2013-11-27 11:48:13	+rnewson	ok, so there's value in the attachments being out on disk, flat.
2013-11-27 11:48:34	isaacs	there's more value (for me) for attachments being on a separate machine
2013-11-27 11:48:41	+rnewson	that is, as well as being known to couchdb, say, also being a folder/file hierarchy you can just read as normal files.
2013-11-27 11:49:04	isaacs	sure, that would be a positive step
2013-11-27 11:49:16	isaacs	if they were not on that hard drive at all, then i wouldn't need a big hard drive for the registry server.
2013-11-27 11:49:33	crewmoss	Any suggestions when a reversed proxy handler starts returning a 500 {"error":"error","reason":"retry_later"}. Other handlers continue to function as does the rest of couch. The only fix I've managed to find thus far is restarting.
2013-11-27 11:49:52	+rnewson	the forms of 'external' attachment where the data is still in the server (or, at least, as openable as any other file, it could be remote) are more reasonable imo

2013-11-27 11:51:41	+rnewson	 /srv/attachments could also be a different disk to /srv/databases, but still local. (larger but slower, say)
2013-11-27 11:52:05	+rnewson	I think you can do that today with a show handler.

2013-11-27 11:52:18	isaacs	yeah it's my plan.  i'm asking becasue i'm curious about what you don't like about it :)
2013-11-27 11:52:45	isaacs	for starters, include_attachments=true fails, right?
2013-11-27 11:52:48	isaacs	or at least, gets kinky
2013-11-27 11:53:26	+rnewson	ah, well I speak from a "what should our database do?" point of view.
2013-11-27 11:53:52	+rnewson	if couchdb doesn't have the attachment bytes themselves, but is merely proxying them, I would want it to be clear to the user that it's the case.
2013-11-27 11:54:09	isaacs	in my suggestion, it would not even proxy.  just redirect.
2013-11-27 11:54:17	isaacs	but yeah, proxying would be another option
2013-11-27 11:55:25	isaacs	(fwiw, i think the nfs mount idea would probably get me like 90% of the way to where i need to be.)
2013-11-27 11:55:26	+rnewson	redirects are good but a fair few clients (curl, notably) don't follow them by default.
2013-11-27 11:55:58	isaacs	that's a good point
2013-11-27 11:56:00	isaacs	ok

2013-11-27 11:57:42	isaacs	so, if you're proxying to a url, why is that more of a lie than pulling them from a different location on disk?
2013-11-27 11:57:57	isaacs	i mean, either way, couchdb is not serving them out of its .couch file, right?

2013-11-27 11:58:35	+rnewson	which could also be different spindles, since database_dir and view_index_dir are configurable

2013-11-27 11:59:11	isaacs	i guess, i don't see why proxying bytes from http is more shady than proxying them from the fs
2013-11-27 11:59:14	+rnewson	e.g, attachments_dir would be a third config variable
2013-11-27 11:59:34	isaacs	is it just that it's less of a shift from how couch currently works?
2013-11-27 11:59:44	+rnewson	a greater probability of independent failure, basically.
2013-11-27 11:59:56	+rnewson	it's still a stretch.
2013-11-27 12:00:05	+rnewson	if you lost view_index_dir, you could recreate it.
2013-11-27 12:00:07	isaacs	i dunno, man.  file systems fail a lot.
2013-11-27 12:00:10	+rnewson	assuming you didn't lose database_dir
2013-11-27 12:00:23	+rnewson	I find disks fail more than filesystems, but sure.
2013-11-27 12:02:59	+rnewson	crewmoss: sorry, that got lost. looks like that's ibrowse itself sending that after 3 tries
2013-11-27 12:04:05	crewmoss	So the assumption would be the service being served is unavailable/having issues?
2013-11-27 12:04:27	crewmoss	In this case, it's a local node process.
2013-11-27 12:05:04	isaacs	rnewson: it seems that att_encoding_info=true does not have any effect on the _changes feed.  is there a way to get that attachment info there as well?
2013-11-27 12:05:17	+rnewson	crewmoss: yeah, sounds like the client requesting the thing you're pointing at is not responding.
2013-11-27 12:05:26	+rnewson	isaacs: hrm, now you're asking... one sec.
2013-11-27 12:07:02	crewmoss	rnewson: my only reason for suspecting couch is that restarting the process in question does not help. Also, and when the same resource is requested directly it responds as expected.

2013-11-27 13:17:20	isaacs	my plan is to make the rewriter send /:pkg/-/:attachment go to /_proxything and then have that proxy to a node server that checks to see if it's in manta, and if so, fetches from the cdn, else fetches from the specific attachment url

I'll I"m getting in the logs is {"error":"error","reason":"retry_later"}. The resource being proxied is responding as expected when requested directly. All other couch handlers seem to function normally. The only fix I have so far is restarting couch. It's happened 3 times in a 7 day period since I've updated to 1.5.

2013-11-30 05:17:46	crewmoss	So I did a clean install of couchdb 1.5 on ubuntu 12.04. Everything is functioning but we are experiencing several bugs that (at this point) require us to restart couch completely. Just looking at the pid's and logs and I'm thinking I did something stupid during the install...

2013-12-07 04:05:07	Kangu	i have a question regarding the $location html5 mode and the hasbang urls in the markup
2013-12-07 04:06:23	Kangu	are the hashbangs still needed for spiders like googlebot to figure out it's a dynamic page and call the _escaped_fragment_ url? there is the meta fragment tag at in head, but does that tell *all* links to be treated with the escaped_fragment call?
2013-12-07 04:06:54	Kangu	this of course when i have the html5 mode set to true and one would be tempted to just type in the clear links

2013-12-07 04:54:04	rudasn	hey I have a question about views.. does the number of views in a database affect performance? is it recommended to have a view for each user, to lets say fetch all docs that relate to a particular user?

2013-12-07 05:22:07	+rnewson	rudasn: a single view keyed on doc.user is fine. there's no performance impact to having many views in a database. the views in each design document are built and managed separately from the others, and from the database. the only performance considerations are whether you have the disk space, cpu, etc to perform the queries / build the indexes you need.

2013-12-07 05:27:32	rudasn	thanks.. my use case is like this: I have some "content" docs, where they store stuff the student will see. I also have "user" docs that store user details (email etc). Say I want to generate and associate data between a user and a content, ie, user with id X has generated data Y regarding content Z. I will be retrieving data Y by user id and content id, ie, fetch Y data for user X on content Z; or fetch all Y data for content Z; or fetch all Y data for use

2013-12-07 05:29:17	rudasn	And I'm considering having each Y data as a new doc and having a view to emit([doc.user_id, doc._content_id], doc.data] so that I can find such data per user or per content 
2013-12-07 05:29:22	rudasn	does that make any sense?

2013-12-07 05:37:29	+rnewson	yes, it does. I'll note that if those users are accessing couchdb directly, you might just add the email addresses to the _users doc used for authentication.
2013-12-07 05:38:19	+rnewson	and a further note that a key of [doc.user_id, doc.content_id] will let you look up all docs for a user using a startkey/endkey slice or a particular content id for a particular user id.
2013-12-07 05:38:33	+rnewson	and not 'per user or per content'.
2013-12-07 05:41:47	Kangu	rnewson: you're right, my question is not quite angular specific.. i'll try on the googlebot side. thanks
2013-12-07 05:42:13	+rnewson	Kangu: um, but if it *was* angular specific, this is still #couchdb...
