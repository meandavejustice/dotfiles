2013-11-26 11:37:12	benzn	and if you use s3, you can't dynamically serve gzipped and non-gzipped content from the same url and some people serve straight gzipped regardless of what the scraper says it can decode

2013-11-26 19:15:58	@spladug	qw3rtman: i don't see that anywhere in the (current) code. maybe something archive.org inserted?

2013-11-26 19:25:05	qw3rtman	Let's hear it
2013-11-26 19:25:16	AnkhMorporkian	When they originally pitched to Y Combinator, Alexis and Steve (their company at the time was called Redbrick Solutions) pitched an idea for a text-ahead ordering service, so you could text in your Starbucks order and it would be ready by the time you got there. According to everything I've seen and read, the idea was rejected, but Paul really liked the two guys and called them back for another meeting so
2013-11-26 19:25:21	AnkhMorporkian	they could discuss funding a different idea. This is where the story gets a little blurry, because of some things Alexis has said.
2013-11-26 19:25:36	AnkhMorporkian	So Alexis' company was originally named Redbrick.

2013-11-26 19:30:40	qw3rtman	I'm going off on a tangent here, but would reddit's frontend code (CSS mainly) be covered under the same license as its backend code (Common Public Attribution License)? (Question for reddit devs)
