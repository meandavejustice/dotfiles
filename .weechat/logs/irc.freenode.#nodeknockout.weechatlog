2013-11-08 18:04:19	CrossEye_	wondering if it's a big deal to comment out the part that depends on process.getuid, which is not available on Windows.
2013-11-08 18:05:08	wolfeidau	CrossEye_: You can just wrap in an if statement
2013-11-08 18:05:16	wolfeidau	Which checks for isProduction
2013-11-08 18:05:44	wolfeidau	so if(isProduction) { that stuff }
2013-11-08 18:06:23	nathanhammond	this works locally, and doesn't when deployed: https://github.com/nko4/ally/blob/master/server.js ... it is throwing ENOENT errors.
2013-11-08 18:06:47	jheusala	looks like even with `process.initgroups('deploy', 1000);` there's still 0 in the list.
2013-11-08 18:07:03	jheusala	(I'm not sure if it should be there anyway.)
2013-11-08 18:07:07	nathanhammond	what do I need to do in order to force the pathing to be relative to server.js?
2013-11-08 18:07:13	Vertice	should we be switching to process.initgroups?
2013-11-08 18:07:19	Vertice	is there a notification ?

2013-11-08 18:08:11	wolfeidau	nathanhammond: On which line?
2013-11-08 18:08:16	jheusala	it should go that 1) you drop group priviledges 2) you change user privileges to normal user 3) then the process shouldn't get root access again.

2013-11-08 21:09:15	gerad	bengl: Entries should be web applications. It's hard for judges (especially the general public) to fairly evaluate entries that require compilation or setup. If you want to submit a non-web app, you're welcome to, but you aren't likely to get judged fairly. If an app is not a website, but some library, utility, or desktop program, then it must be deployed to the npm registry.
2013-11-08 21:09:27	gerad	If you do decide to submit something that isn't immediately accessible via the web, then we encourage you to think of a clever way to share it as a website (e.g. via VNC) or market it (e.g. jQuery Quicksand).

2013-11-09 16:27:41	mikolalysenko	hmm
2013-11-09 16:27:58	wolfeidau	Miezel: any hints from ./deploy nko exec tail /home/deploy/shared/logs/server/current
2013-11-09 16:28:06	wolfeidau	or ./deploy nko exec tail /tmp/deploy.log
2013-11-09 16:28:34	mikolalysenko	woloski: can you give docker a timequota?
2013-11-09 16:29:25	woloski	mm no, it's just a safe container
2013-11-09 16:29:29	woloski	but you could use this
2013-11-09 16:29:29	woloski	https://github.com/gf3/sandbox
2013-11-09 16:30:12	mikolalysenko	woloski: that would work!
2013-11-09 16:30:25	mikolalysenko	no memory limit, but meh
2013-11-09 16:30:29	mikolalysenko	good enough for nko
2013-11-09 16:30:33	woloski	yep
2013-11-09 16:30:59	woloski	if you want real constraints on ram, cpu, disk then docker
2013-11-09 16:31:13	woloski	for the nko that module should help
2013-11-09 16:31:40	woloski	it will spin up a node process for each execution (not very scalable though)

2013-11-09 18:38:51	rvagg	Miezel, wolfeidau: that's kind of odd, you can just try `npm install` again to see if it gets fixed
2013-11-09 18:38:55	rvagg	or is this on a deploy?
2013-11-09 18:40:15	rvagg	unfortunately mquery is pinned against exactly debug@0.7.0 and there is an 0.7.3 also in your dep tree, that shouldn't matter but it'd be nice if it wasn't pinned

2013-11-10 14:53:50	srobin	It says I've only deployed once, yesterday, despite having deployed multiple times since then
2013-11-10 14:54:15	srobin	my actual site is up to date though
2013-11-10 14:54:28	wolfeidau	srobin: did you remove the nko module ?

2013-11-10 14:55:09	wolfeidau	srobin: there is some logic in the nko module which is in the server.js which pings on deploy
2013-11-10 14:55:12	wolfeidau	I believe
2013-11-10 14:55:23	luismreis	as in: run vmstat on the terminal, and it opens a window with this charts.
2013-11-10 14:55:25	srobin	I have all modules gitignored, but it's in my package.json so I would that it would be fine

2013-11-10 14:57:44	sturadnidge	luismreis: right gotcha
