2013-11-11 14:00:44	dukesam	schmichael: you need to hire yourself out to pivotal: 'The only thing it’s [Mongo] good at is storing arbitrary pieces of JSON. “Arbitrary,” in this context, means that you don’t care at all what’s inside that JSON.'
2013-11-11 14:01:01	dukesam	Mongo, awesome where any other DB include a flat file would be awesome

2013-11-11 14:03:14	justinabrahms	I very much dislike it. If I knew of a way to make it not like that, I would make it not like that. *shrug*
2013-11-11 14:03:27	justinabrahms	idea: networked flat file as a service.
2013-11-11 14:04:30	justinabrahms	JSON_voorhees points out that's effectively "cloud files"
2013-11-11 14:04:37	JSON_voorhees	ugh
2013-11-11 14:05:01	justinabrahms	the "value add" comes when you expose a backwards compatible mongodb interface in front. Huzzah!

2013-11-11 15:21:59	schmichael	ha, wtf is going on?
2013-11-11 15:23:27	justinabrahms	It appears to take into account the indentation of the code being commented on.
2013-11-11 15:23:52	justinabrahms	unfortunately due to requirejs, 100% of all files are wrapped in a function call, meaning we get the entire file for every inline comment (I think that's what's happening at least)
2013-11-11 15:24:12	gmcquillan	justinabrahms, that's not new, though.
2013-11-11 15:24:27	justinabrahms	gmcquillan: I'll say this is the first time its ever happened for me.

2013-11-11 15:25:19	schmichael	as if they're adding to a context variable in each loop over the comments to display

2013-11-11 15:27:57	justinabrahms	also worth bitching about the fact that this PR tab is taking 420MB of ram to render.

2013-11-12 14:14:24	marcalarc	Another thing I thought was a little weird – their "Tonkotsu" is actually virginia ham

2013-11-12 14:16:35	marcalarc	well technically I guess tonkotsu is the name for the pork broth...I guess you'd call it chashu when referring to the cutlet
2013-11-12 14:16:44	marcalarc	in any event, a little weird
2013-11-12 14:16:49	marcalarc	but not untasty
2013-11-12 14:17:14	marcalarc	I thought the portions were fine. You might be pressed to complain if you think that 10 dollars is a lot for a bowl of soup (which I guess it is)
2013-11-12 14:17:31	marcalarc	but the broth is so rich you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you ate more than what they served you
2013-11-12 14:17:55	mihasya	yo bitprophet UAs jenkins builds create a new tag for every build in git right? is that done via some jenkins plugin thing, or just as part of shell script?
2013-11-12 14:18:02	marcalarc	mtrichardson: I love this idea
2013-11-12 14:18:26	marcalarc	I mourn the non-existence of a blade runner-style japanese fusion dystopia
2013-11-12 14:18:31	marcalarc	at least culinarily speaking
2013-11-12 14:18:45	hackygolucky	gmcquillan: no take-backsies?
2013-11-12 14:18:52	mtrichardson	"This tastes... kind of oily... I guess?" "That's because we put crude oil in it."
2013-11-12 14:18:56	bitprophet	mihasya: they used to, we stopped that shit lately though, inflates git for no great reason (usually)
2013-11-12 14:18:57	coddingtonbear	Jenkins, mihasya
2013-11-12 14:19:00	marcalarc	lololol
2013-11-12 14:19:02	bitprophet	mihasya: anyway that was the git plugin
2013-11-12 14:19:04	bitprophet	iirc
2013-11-12 14:19:13	bitprophet	it was def not a shell script, it was in-jenkins
2013-11-12 14:19:19	coddingtonbear	in an action named something like "Git Publisher"
2013-11-12 14:19:19	bitprophet	or what coddingtonbear said
2013-11-12 14:20:57	mihasya	lordy.. okie doke
2013-11-12 14:21:12	mihasya	bitprophet "inflates git" how so? just the long list of tags?
2013-11-12 14:21:28	marcalarc	schmichael: no I've never been to Biwa on a not busy night
2013-11-12 14:21:41	marcalarc	it's worth it though
2013-11-12 14:21:45	schmichael	definitely
2013-11-12 14:21:49	marcalarc	and they have a fabulous sake list
2013-11-12 14:21:51	schmichael	we just need to start leaving bad yelp reviews
2013-11-12 14:22:18	marcalarc	find a happy medium where they aren't so bad that the restaurant goes out of business
2013-11-12 14:22:31	bitprophet	mihasya: yes
2013-11-12 14:22:43	bitprophet	mihasya: eventually git cloning and searching and stuff takes _forever_ :(
2013-11-12 14:22:48	bitprophet	not to mention github's UI...heh
2013-11-12 14:22:53	marcalarc	"No Wifi. Less space than a Nomad. Lame."
2013-11-12 14:23:02	mihasya	bitprophet rgr
2013-11-12 14:25:28	lolsborn	Anyone using btsync?
2013-11-12 14:28:05	schmichael	lolsborn: aaron, lytics's cto, loves it. but my only coworker he convinced to install it said it would randomly overwrite files with older versions
2013-11-12 14:28:13	schmichael	so i've stayed away
2013-11-12 14:28:19	schmichael	aaron is *obsessed* though
2013-11-12 14:29:36	lolsborn	We have some relatively large files (2g) I dont' really want clogging up everyone's dropbox and github won't allow release files that size
2013-11-12 14:29:45	lolsborn	so I'm looking at using it for that.
2013-11-12 14:30:27	lolsborn	We won't be updating them often so I hope they don't get stomped on.
2013-11-12 14:31:20	schmichael	lolsborn: i'd love to hear how it works for you. it seems so silly that in 2013 it's still hard to share large files
2013-11-12 14:33:45	justinabrahms	put it on s3?
2013-11-12 14:34:31	schmichael	justinabrahms: manual syncing, costs money, and is nontrivial to secure if everyone doesn't already have aws keys setup
2013-11-12 14:34:43	justinabrahms	fair.
2013-11-12 14:34:58	schmichael	i mean it's a good option; just sad a usb stick is often easier
2013-11-12 14:35:05	jumpinggrendel	you'd have to split it up too i think 
2013-11-12 14:35:28	jefftowle	schmichael: also costs money. unless you're a shoplifter, which i always suspected. the beard.
2013-11-12 14:35:50	schmichael	it's where i hide stolen aws keys
2013-11-12 14:47:21	mtrichardson	usbeard key
2013-11-12 14:47:33	gmcquillan	!m mtrichardson 
2013-11-12 14:47:33	pmxxbot	you're doing good work, mtrichardson!
2013-11-12 14:48:54	schmichael	ericholscher: did you get a picture of me beardless chopping wood?
2013-11-12 14:49:25	mtrichardson	....most hipster question ever
2013-11-12 14:49:59	schmichael	i had mustac...oh
2013-11-12 14:51:45	jefftowle	schmichael: did sam make you get rid of the mustache?
2013-11-12 14:52:28	schmichael	jefftowle: i couldn't tame its power. i shaved it before falling asleep that night
2013-11-12 14:52:36	schmichael	for fear it would consume me in my sleep
2013-11-12 14:52:56	jefftowle	:'(
2013-11-12 14:53:11	ericholscher	schmichael: wat
2013-11-12 14:53:15	schmichael	wat
2013-11-12 14:53:51	schmichael	ericholscher: halloween? wood chopping pic? maybe you weren't there

2013-11-12 14:56:35	gmcquillan	Drinking whiskey and watching the stormy ocean.
2013-11-12 14:56:38	gmcquillan	It's a right of passage.

2013-11-12 15:24:50	marcalarc	mtrichardson: you could go to portmeirion and pretend to be a character in the prisoner
2013-11-12 15:25:17	mtrichardson	marcalarc: I bet the lines to do that are insane

2013-12-02 14:56:52	chrisdickinson	the other side of it is coffeescript where assign declares or sets in scope
2013-12-02 14:57:15	cbeck	I like java's treatment, necessitating that captured refs be final
2013-12-02 14:57:17	chrisdickinson	which ends up in insanity
2013-12-02 14:57:25	kdj	cbeck: I like that too
2013-12-02 14:57:36	JSON_voorhees	https://pastee.org/u8x2n
2013-12-02 14:57:45	schmichael	cbeck, kdj: example?
2013-12-02 14:57:56	kdj	But would kill some of the nice state mashing you can do in go routines in the simplest case
2013-12-02 14:58:30	kdj	schmichael: No changing assignment of outer variables in an enclosed scope
2013-12-02 14:59:26	chrisdickinson	kdj: so java requires closure references to be values / value objects?
2013-12-02 14:59:37	cbeck	chrisdickinson: No
2013-12-02 14:59:44	cbeck	I'll have an example in a sec
2013-12-02 14:59:48	chrisdickinson	i.e., immutable?
2013-12-02 15:00:10	kdj	chrisdickinson: The reference has to be immutable
2013-12-02 15:00:20	kdj	(I think is how one would say it)
2013-12-02 15:00:32	kdj	cbeck's example will be more enlightening

2013-12-02 15:01:03	schmichael	so it's python's scoping (sans-global keyword madness)
2013-12-02 15:01:08	chrisdickinson	kdj: that makes sense
2013-12-02 15:01:14	schmichael	you can mutate enclosed variables' values, but not reassign
2013-12-02 15:01:39	schmichael	(if it's a mutable type obviously)

2013-12-02 15:05:41	schmichael	the weird thing about lambdas in java is that they snuck in multiple inheritance of sorts (via default methods on interfaces) to implement it

2013-12-02 15:07:16	schmichael	good post on it: http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-8-explained-default-methods/

2013-12-04 13:10:31	kdj	But thanks for the warning
2013-12-04 13:11:06	schmichael	is it because everyone in the western conference is mean to them?
2013-12-04 13:11:16	schmichael	given my experience with sports, that seems the most likely reason
2013-12-04 13:11:51	rmayhem	the #3 team in the east has a 9 wins and 9 losses
2013-12-04 13:11:52	kdj	I think the Eastern Conference has better health care benefits and perks.
2013-12-04 13:12:33	schmichael	50/50 seems pretty good to me

2013-12-04 13:47:41	robotadam	the sim card that comes with the unlocked iphone is only valid for post paid, and the tmobile store can't sell a unactivated prepaid kit, and they can't select the $30 plan

2013-12-06 10:49:59	vitaminmoo	luckythetourist: funny,b ut not wrong
2013-12-06 10:52:32	luckythetourist	so do you watch the openssh-dev mailing list and read the source changes every day?
2013-12-06 10:54:20	vitaminmoo	luckythetourist: I am on a bunch of generic security mailinglists
2013-12-06 10:54:21	vitaminmoo	so yes
2013-12-06 10:54:27	vitaminmoo	and no, that's what the security mailinglists are for
2013-12-06 10:54:31	luckythetourist	i didn't realize you vetted their code
2013-12-06 10:54:38	vitaminmoo	luckythetourist: also we don't update ssh every time they commit to git
2013-12-06 10:54:58	luckythetourist	so what version are you on then?
2013-12-06 10:55:38	vitaminmoo	an older version with redhat's standard security fix backporting
2013-12-06 10:55:54	luckythetourist	what's the difference between that and upstream?
2013-12-06 10:56:13	vitaminmoo	upstream is ejaculated directly onto the internet with new features, redhats is $old_version with only security changes
2013-12-06 10:57:25	luckythetourist	i assumed you'd be able to give me a digest
2013-12-06 10:57:29	luckythetourist	as you have such knowledge
2013-12-06 10:57:36	luckythetourist	since you vet the code and read all emails in the list
2013-12-06 10:57:38	luckythetourist	:P
2013-12-06 10:58:45	vitaminmoo	luckythetourist: I bet you have a script tailing openssh's git repo and automatically compiling/installing/restarting
2013-12-06 10:58:48	vitaminmoo	because you trust them
2013-12-06 10:58:55	luckythetourist	of course i do
2013-12-06 10:59:00	luckythetourist	i update ssh every 20 minutes
2013-12-06 10:59:02	luckythetourist	it's on a cron
2013-12-06 10:59:06	vitaminmoo	20? plebe
2013-12-06 10:59:12	vitaminmoo	polling is so 2010
2013-12-06 10:59:29	luckythetourist	well i never said i wasn't a plebe
2013-12-06 10:59:35	cbeck	20 minutes? And I thought you wanted to be *bleeding* edge

2013-12-10 11:37:44	ericholscher	portland has many of the same issues
2013-12-10 11:37:59	ericholscher	people move there and don't fulfill there potential, and there are lots of "belonging" politics
2013-12-10 11:38:39	maaaaaaaaaaarc	the near universal hatred of hipsters mirrors the hatred of gentrifiers and transplants
2013-12-10 11:39:28	maaaaaaaaaaarc	in both cases (with the partial exception of transplants) those categories exist on a continuum on which everyone functions
2013-12-10 11:39:59	maaaaaaaaaaarc	the hipster or the gentrifier (or the transplant vs the non-native "local") is always the other

2013-12-10 11:41:49	maaaaaaaaaaarc	the funny thing about SF is I think more than 80% of residents are non-natives
2013-12-10 11:42:47	maaaaaaaaaaarc	so it's pretty silly for people to be getting in a kerfluffle about tech worker transplants, as though they have less of a right to live there than the people who moved into the mission 6 years ago and displaced poor families then
2013-12-10 11:42:48	ncaudill	maaaaaaaaaaarc: pretty much everyone is a non-native if you look back far enough
2013-12-10 11:43:32	maaaaaaaaaaarc	ncaudill: agreed and I don't really think that nativeness, whatever that means, entails a moral right to a place
2013-12-10 11:43:56	maaaaaaaaaaarc	but in the current scheme of things, a claim to nativeness does seem to carry a fair amount of social capital
2013-12-10 11:44:27	ericholscher	I almost feel native in portland after being there 3 years :)
2013-12-10 11:44:54	maaaaaaaaaaarc	me tooish, although my story is very similar to that of the guy writing from berlin
2013-12-10 11:45:00	maaaaaaaaaaarc	almost everyone I know is an 'expat'
2013-12-10 11:45:15	maaaaaaaaaaarc	it says more about what it means to be a transplant than it does about the city itself, IMO

2013-12-11 10:23:52	hackygolucky	some gluten free baking you'd never even notice.
2013-12-11 10:24:05	hackygolucky	but people go bananas for things like rice flour and then you've got sandpaper cookies
2013-12-11 10:24:48	maaaaaaaaaaarc	rice flour is pretty gross
2013-12-11 10:25:06	vitaminmoo	maaaaaaaaaaarc: it's more dust than flour
2013-12-11 10:25:28	gmcquillan	Almond flour is pretty amazing in cookies.
2013-12-11 10:25:49	schmichael	dave's girlfriends makes some good gluten free donuts, but they're definitely just totally different than normal donuts

2013-12-11 10:26:13	gmcquillan	I saw a commercial for gluten free dog food last night.

2013-12-11 10:28:35	luckythetourist	quinoa flour is also good
2013-12-11 10:28:43	luckythetourist	mainly because it doesn't have a very strong flavor

2013-12-11 11:05:49	gmcquillan	Python data munging.
2013-12-11 11:06:03	gmcquillan	We have a bunch of government contracts for aggregating building power data.

2013-12-11 11:07:36	gmcquillan	We're looking at redshift, so I've been spreading that around again.
2013-12-11 11:08:18	schmichael	gmcquillan: you should checkout google's bigquery too. mainly because i want to know how they compare ;)
2013-12-11 11:08:32	jumpinggrendel	sup with glidr?
2013-12-11 11:10:21	gmcquillan	Not too sure.
2013-12-11 11:10:34	gmcquillan	schmichael, hmm.
2013-12-11 11:10:44	gmcquillan	I haven't thought to look.
2013-12-11 11:11:17	gmcquillan	All the Google Developer tools seem hopelessly hard to use easily. E.g. the charges for deletes to your onestore data.
2013-12-11 11:11:23	gmcquillan	So even cancelling your account costs money, and is extremely slow.
2013-12-11 11:11:56	schmichael	hm, not sure about that, but their console does indeed suck
2013-12-11 11:12:12	gmcquillan	Well, that was my impression as of four years ago.
2013-12-11 11:12:15	gmcquillan	I haven't really looked back.
2013-12-11 11:12:34	schmichael	and being able to use a psql driver is way nicer than having to write your own client lib or use goog's autogenerated one
2013-12-11 11:12:34	gmcquillan	I seem to remember reading that you can actually have background processes run in GAE now.
2013-12-11 11:12:39	gmcquillan	So that's innovative.
2013-12-11 11:12:49	gmcquillan	schmichael, totally.
2013-12-11 11:13:01	gmcquillan	Redshift seems like a great solution.
2013-12-11 11:13:14	schmichael	bigquery just seems nice for arbitrary offline queries against large tables
2013-12-11 11:13:37	kdj	Its a cloud you can throw things at
2013-12-11 11:13:52	kdj	And then do cloudy things on it
2013-12-11 11:13:57	kdj	It seems pretty good for that

2013-12-11 13:11:44	gmcquillan	coddingtonbear, nice footage.
2013-12-11 13:14:08	ericholscher	coddingtonbear: ouch
2013-12-11 13:15:32	gmcquillan	You okay, though?
2013-12-11 13:15:38	gmcquillan	Looks like you hopped right back on.
2013-12-11 13:17:20	gmcquillan	Also "Pandora's Promise" has Stuart Brand; of course I'll like it.
2013-12-11 13:17:56	gmcquillan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0p8m0JMstHc
2013-12-11 13:20:21	gmcquillan	Easy solution: everybody empty out a bunch of smoke detectors into a big brew pot, and make their own "reactors" at home.
2013-12-11 13:20:32	gmcquillan	Free energy for life.
2013-12-11 13:21:49	gmcquillan	coddingtonbear, have you seen the film yet?
2013-12-11 13:23:29	coddingtonbear	yep
2013-12-11 13:23:32	coddingtonbear	we watched it last night
2013-12-11 13:24:12	gmcquillan	!m coddingtonbear 
2013-12-11 13:24:13	schmichael	didn't fall on my ass this time! if i keep it up maybe i can get my training wheels taken off!
2013-12-11 13:24:13	pmxxbot	you're doing good work, coddingtonbear!
2013-12-11 13:24:21	gmcquillan	!m schmichael 
2013-12-11 13:24:22	pmxxbot	you're doing good work, schmichael!
2013-12-11 13:24:25	coddingtonbear	it was super interesting
2013-12-11 13:24:37	gmcquillan	Maybe I can con Clare into watching it with me.
2013-12-11 13:24:47	gmcquillan	Is it available for download or something?
2013-12-11 13:24:52	gmcquillan	Can't easily get to a theatre.
2013-12-11 13:24:53	coddingtonbear	there's this scene where he's talking about the 'death footprint' of various technologies
2013-12-11 13:25:06	coddingtonbear	and nuclear is at the bottom -- below hydro and solar
2013-12-11 13:25:21	schmichael	below solar?!
2013-12-11 13:25:25	hackygolucky	coddingtonbear: aw, you could see how awful the road was when the camera was so close to the ground :-/
2013-12-11 13:25:29	coddingtonbear	solar was obvious -- apparently photovoltaic cells are quite toxic to manufacture
2013-12-11 13:25:35	gmcquillan	schmichael, solar takes a lot of energy to manufacture, and takes up a lot of space.
2013-12-11 13:25:38	schmichael	oh my
2013-12-11 13:25:46	coddingtonbear	hyrdo, though, was more interesting, and they didn't mention it in the film
2013-12-11 13:26:11	gmcquillan	Hydro has a bunch of non-obvious costs.
2013-12-11 13:26:13	coddingtonbear	but apparently the reason it has a larger 'death footprint' -- given some after-movie research -- is that there was a dam in China that failed in the seventies
2013-12-11 13:26:19	coddingtonbear	and more than a hundred thousand people died
2013-12-11 13:26:28	gmcquillan	For example, how do you replace a dam that's too old?
2013-12-11 13:26:50	coddingtonbear	yes, we rented it on itunes, gmcquillan, btw
2013-12-11 13:26:55	gmcquillan	coddingtonbear, kk.
2013-12-11 13:27:14	gmcquillan	Over the life of a dam sediment builds up behind it putting more and more pressure.
2013-12-11 13:27:17	jefftowle	gmcquillan: like a bathtub
2013-12-11 13:27:22	gmcquillan	Eventually, the structure can't hold it.
2013-12-11 13:28:16	gmcquillan	jefftowle, totally. Drop some ceramic into a river from orbit and call it good.

2013-12-11 13:29:57	coddingtonbear	yup -- especially the new version
2013-12-11 13:30:02	coddingtonbear	there's a looping mode
2013-12-11 13:30:11	coddingtonbear	so you can use it in a dashcammy kind of way
2013-12-11 13:30:26	robotadam	I wonder how much energy I'm consuming (in addition to baseline) by watching this 2 hour youtube video of a log fireplace, based on my own laptop's power, network infra, and google infra
2013-12-11 13:30:48	gmcquillan	robotadam, wut.
2013-12-11 13:30:51	ericholscher	more or less than burning a log?

2013-12-11 13:31:06	schmichael	coddingtonbear: that's awesome
2013-12-11 13:31:24	robotadam	ericholscher: good question, have to consider carbon footprint in addition to just kWh
2013-12-11 13:31:40	ericholscher	the heat isn't being used in a reasonable way -- though up the chimney isn't great either
2013-12-11 13:31:44	schmichael	do people buy offsets anymore?
2013-12-11 13:31:50	schmichael	wasn't that a thing a few years ago?
2013-12-11 13:32:04	robotadam	I think corps do, havent seen consumer pushes for a while
2013-12-11 13:32:19	coddingtonbear	hmm, a man from NWN came to my door a few months back
2013-12-11 13:32:25	coddingtonbear	and sold offsets to us
2013-12-11 13:32:37	robotadam	ericholscher: oddly enough, we were talking to an home energy assessor, and they said if you're using it to heat your house, wood is better than natural gas, but it depends on having the right layout
2013-12-11 13:32:46	robotadam	as far as fireplace insert, that is
2013-12-11 13:32:50	schmichael	coddingtonbear: that sounds... shady
2013-12-11 13:32:53	ericholscher	wood stove, or fireplace?
2013-12-11 13:33:01	kdj	I should get into the offset-offset market
2013-12-11 13:33:02	robotadam	fireplace vs. nat gas fireplace insert
2013-12-11 13:33:04	coddingtonbear	oh, it just comes in as a line-item on our NWN bill

2013-12-11 13:55:40	jefftowle	yup
2013-12-11 13:55:49	gmcquillan	I love that regulation.

2013-12-11 13:56:19	gmcquillan	I'm not sure if it's so much to protect people from stupidly spending their retirement savings so much as creating a social class of people who make money by having some.
2013-12-11 13:56:22	jefftowle	essentially an admission of imbalance
2013-12-11 13:56:37	gmcquillan	That's how it seems to me.

2013-12-11 13:57:48	jefftowle	right. so it's hardly a protection against anything.
2013-12-11 13:58:16	gmcquillan	Yuup.

2013-12-11 15:43:16	schmichael	their track on give 'em the boot seems to be off a single that rdio doesn't have
2013-12-11 15:43:21	schmichael	but this album is really fun so far
2013-12-11 15:45:05	schmichael	"The addition of many recommendations of smoking crack rock -- whether or not this is serious was never really determined -- makes Choking Victim the antithesis of every ska-punk band out there. So, yeah, not only do these guys preach the anti-sobriety/anti-religious message, but there's also a serious anti-life/anti-nationalistic theme going on with the band. "
2013-12-11 15:45:11	schmichael	reviews of punk albums are great
2013-12-11 15:50:00	kdj	Okay, but seriously, who wants to start a punk band?

2013-12-11 16:24:10	schmichael	maybe barroom heros... dropkick murphys is what i usually transition to
2013-12-11 16:24:35	schmichael	i'm realizing why comps are so good though
2013-12-11 16:24:52	JSON_voorhees	you ever seen that video of leftover crack doing 500 channels and mid song they switch to a dammit cover? the riffs are so similiar... its perfect
2013-12-11 16:24:59	schmichael	i don't really need more than half a dozen 2 minute songs from any given band

2013-12-12 13:44:38	gmcquillan	It's called the Copenhagen Wheel because it was announced to coincide with the Copenhagen climate meeting.
2013-12-12 13:44:40	gmcquillan	When was that..
2013-12-12 13:44:56	gmcquillan	2009

2013-12-12 14:02:09	schmichael	jefftowle: i think people pay much more than $700 for better bikes that allow them to peddle slightly less, so while that price point isn't what i would pay, i think the concept is great

2013-12-12 14:03:52	robotadam	I would pay $700 to have some extra power for hills + carrying lots of groceries, if it worked well and was fun
2013-12-12 14:03:59	robotadam	I'd use it instead of a car2go for some trips

2013-12-12 17:08:23	gmcquillan	pdf, there's like a $20 set that comes with some figurines and a map and a few scenarios.
2013-12-12 17:08:29	gmcquillan	I think you can pick it up at Powell's even.

2014-01-01 20:09:24	vitaminmoo	btw
2014-01-01 20:09:39	schmichael	hahaha
2014-01-01 20:09:49	schmichael	Iconoclastic Python
2014-01-01 20:10:47	vitaminmoo	It's the counter-pythonesque movement
2014-01-01 20:10:51	vitaminmoo	Where you justify doing things
2014-01-01 20:10:59	vitaminmoo	Because they're not pythonish
2014-01-01 20:11:39	schmichael	What Would Larry Wall Do?
2014-01-01 20:11:48	vitaminmoo	What would Guido judge me for doing?
2014-01-01 20:12:08	vitaminmoo	What would Linus call me a dumb fucker on Google+ for typing?
2014-01-01 20:12:26	schmichael	speaking of
2014-01-01 20:12:31	schmichael	i wrote some C today
2014-01-01 20:12:37	schmichael	holy shit what a language
2014-01-01 20:12:42	vitaminmoo	C is a magical thing
2014-01-01 20:13:05	vitaminmoo	It's a pure land, where you receive everything you deserve, and then maybe a bit more of the same
2014-01-01 20:13:08	schmichael	i changed a macro in such a way that it worked for all cases except when it was given an assignment expression instead of just an expression
2014-01-01 20:13:11	schmichael	i have no idea why
2014-01-01 20:13:26	schmichael	fuck assignment expressions
2014-01-01 20:13:40	vitaminmoo	Really all assignments are a waste of memory
2014-01-01 20:13:42	vitaminmoo	Just bit twiddle
2014-01-01 20:14:28	schmichael	i just mmap a few gigs and assign all variables to the hash of their name
2014-01-01 20:15:33	vitaminmoo	DJB's magical 33 hash, I hiope
2014-01-01 20:15:36	dcolish	schmichael: how'd that go?
2014-01-01 20:15:51	vitaminmoo	    items = dict([(sanitize(_), categorize(_)) for _ in summary.keys() if key_filter(_)]
2014-01-01 20:15:57	vitaminmoo	89 chars because fuck you
2014-01-01 20:16:22	vitaminmoo	Also python's rrd libraries are almost as bad in python as they are ina ll other languages
2014-01-01 20:16:37	schmichael	dcolish: C's incredibly weak type system is its largest asset
2014-01-01 20:16:42	schmichael	there's nothing a void* can't fix
2014-01-01 20:16:50	vitaminmoo	schmichael: keep talking, I'm almost finished
2014-01-01 20:16:54	dcolish	vitaminmoo: you can remove the extra list there and just use a generator of tuples
2014-01-01 20:17:02	dcolish	schmichael: my ribs were amaze
2014-01-01 20:17:07	schmichael	you definitely won
2014-01-01 20:17:21	dcolish	ribs are the C of meat
2014-01-01 20:17:37	vitaminmoo	I need to do some 72 hour spare ribs sous vide
2014-01-01 20:17:44	vitaminmoo	It's supposed to be amazing
2014-01-01 20:17:46	schmichael	vitaminmoo: and remove the .keys() call, it's redundant
2014-01-01 20:17:48	dcolish	hmm
2014-01-01 20:18:01	vitaminmoo	oh because fucking python .iter bs
2014-01-01 20:18:03	dcolish	vitaminmoo: but you wouldnt get a bark on them
2014-01-01 20:19:37	vitaminmoo	or short ribs: http://i.imgur.com/PiNf8uv.jpg
2014-01-01 20:19:44	vitaminmoo	medium ribs? black magic, you say? NYETR
2014-01-01 20:20:16	dcolish	were those sous vide?
2014-01-01 20:20:37	dcolish	possibly seared first?
2014-01-01 20:20:45	vitaminmoo	first or after
2014-01-01 20:20:49	dcolish	sure
2014-01-01 20:20:52	vitaminmoo	Gotta justify owning a blowtorch somehow
2014-01-01 20:21:08	dcolish	nah, just use a charcoal chimney and a bbq grate
2014-01-01 20:21:17	vitaminmoo	My torch gets hotter
2014-01-01 20:21:39	vitaminmoo	mmchugh and I were talking about using a piece of steel that had been recently exfiltrated from his forge to sear meat
2014-01-01 20:21:42	dcolish	whats its fuel?
2014-01-01 20:21:44	vitaminmoo	I'm not sure if he was joking, but I'm not
2014-01-01 20:21:46	vitaminmoo	butane
2014-01-01 20:22:18	vitaminmoo	The metal cowl of my torch gets nice and incandescent
2014-01-01 20:22:32	dcolish	yeah they can hit pretty high temps
2014-01-01 20:22:48	dcolish	but they only heat a very small area
2014-01-01 20:22:58	vitaminmoo	yeah, takes a minute to get a sear everywhere
2014-01-01 20:23:05	dcolish	iirc, there's a hot iron technique in japanese cooking
2014-01-01 20:23:16	vitaminmoo	I also have a 14000 btu iwatani butane wok burner to put a cast iron pan on
2014-01-01 20:24:00	dcolish	yeah those are pretty cool
2014-01-01 20:24:23	vitaminmoo	I'm this || close to buying a chamber vac
2014-01-01 20:24:25	dcolish	i wanted to get an outdoor propane stove with a 90K btu jet on it
2014-01-01 20:25:13	vitaminmoo	I used to borrow my brother's candy burner for brewing - no idea on btu, but it was cast-iron, about 3 feet tall, the jet ring was about 12" across, and if you turned it all the way up the flames would go about 10'
2014-01-01 20:25:46	vitaminmoo	At some point you just give up and ziptie a bunch of oxy-acetalene torch heads together
2014-01-01 20:25:46	dcolish	sounds right
2014-01-01 20:25:59	dcolish	you just need a wide heating tip
2014-01-01 20:26:00	vitaminmoo	Then throw your platinum cookware on it
2014-01-01 20:26:26	vitaminmoo	or, kelly's input: just get a hot air baloon burner (23 million btu)
2014-01-01 20:26:34	vitaminmoo	(not a typo)
2014-01-01 20:26:36	dcolish	ha
2014-01-01 20:26:45	dcolish	maybe if you need to sear a hog
2014-01-01 20:26:48	mmchugh	vitaminmoo: I was not joking.
2014-01-01 20:26:50	vitaminmoo	Her dad uses theirs for their halloween dragon
2014-01-01 20:26:57	vitaminmoo	mmchugh: nice
2014-01-01 20:27:08	dcolish	mmchugh: how'd it work out?
2014-01-01 20:27:21	vitaminmoo	Kelly's dad cooked gumbo on her hot air balloon during a hurricane
2014-01-01 20:27:23	dcolish	it sounds like a nice way to cook tenderloin
2014-01-01 20:27:29	mmchugh	I haven't done it, yet
2014-01-01 20:27:31	vitaminmoo	And by on the burner, I mean on the pilot light
2014-01-01 20:27:32	dcolish	oh
2014-01-01 20:27:38	vitaminmoo	mmchugh: lets - srs
2014-01-01 20:27:38	mmchugh	But it would be fun to try
2014-01-01 20:27:44	dcolish	+1
2014-01-01 20:28:08	dcolish	oooh, prime rib
2014-01-01 20:28:22	dcolish	or some ribeyes
2014-01-01 20:28:25	dcolish	damn it
2014-01-01 20:28:32	vitaminmoo	ALL OF TEHSE THINGS
2014-01-01 20:28:35	dcolish	i'm getting hungry again
2014-01-01 20:28:40	mmchugh	I could fit about a 3" wide piece of steel in the forge
2014-01-01 20:28:48	vitaminmoo	Ok I need to go make dinner, which will be some veges done sous vide, and a tuna smammich
2014-01-01 20:28:52	vitaminmoo	mmchugh: nice
2014-01-01 20:28:59	dcolish	ok so that sounds like tenderloin sized
2014-01-01 20:28:59	vitaminmoo	mmchugh: sounds about as wide as a ny strip steak
2014-01-01 20:29:07	mmchugh	:)
2014-01-01 20:29:23	vitaminmoo	Categorizing cow parts by how they will fit on a piece of metal that fits in a forge
2014-01-01 20:29:26	vitaminmoo	I like it

2014-01-02 13:14:39	schmichael	i'm guessing google just wanted the IP since NFC isn't taking off

2014-01-02 13:29:34	schmichael	all his family is back in ohio, they're making him do java which he hates
2014-01-02 13:29:34	gmcquillan	Yeah, I think Goog fixed a lot of their "getting to say you work here is part of the compensation pacakge"
2014-01-02 13:29:40	schmichael	it must have been a *really* good package
2014-01-02 13:29:59	gmcquillan	It's $$$ to work there now.
2014-01-02 13:30:06	schmichael	yeah, he's definitely not the kind of guy to care about the cachet of working for goog
2014-01-02 13:34:08	gmcquillan	Come enterprise for 1/4 mil a year.
2014-01-02 13:34:08	gmcquillan	You'll only spend 50% of it on housing :D

2014-01-02 13:52:36	Wraithan	bitprophet: google pays hundreds of millions of dollars to be default search engine and default home page
2014-01-02 13:52:42	bitprophet	interesting
2014-01-02 13:52:56	Wraithan	20%+ of the market share starting up their browser on their site
2014-01-02 13:53:03	Wraithan	turns out that is a lot of people
2014-01-02 13:53:04	bitprophet	Now I want to see an up to date browser marketshare breakdown
2014-01-02 13:53:13	bitprophet	^^ that works too tho
2014-01-02 13:53:19	bitprophet	how does it compare to Chrome and Safari nowadays?
2014-01-02 13:53:25	bitprophet	(assuming IE is still something like 60+%)
2014-01-02 13:53:36	Wraithan	desktop safari doesn't register
2014-01-02 13:53:44	vitaminmoo	fucking fortunately
2014-01-02 13:53:48	bitprophet	Also, Apple changing to...yahoo? I think? in all their stuff recently is interesting
2014-01-02 13:54:02	bitprophet	it confused a few of my relatives
2014-01-02 13:54:21	vitaminmoo	I think yahoo really fits apple's asthetic better

2014-01-02 13:54:37	Wraithan	Chrome and IE have been duking it out at the top, I think chrome is more popular in lots of countries but IE still wins global?
2014-01-02 13:54:52	vitaminmoo	Thanks, corporate america
2014-01-02 13:55:02	Wraithan	vitaminmoo: actually chrome wins in US
2014-01-02 13:55:11	vitaminmoo	I am genuinely surprised by that
2014-01-02 13:55:23	bitprophet	Wraithan: over IE?
2014-01-02 13:55:29	bitprophet	I would also be genuinely surprised

2014-01-02 14:34:16	Wraithan	mmchugh: because imgur tosses .jpg on all of their images and then uses headers to tell your browser how to handle it, as well as a lot of image processing libraries being able to work out what is thrown at them without external hinting

2014-01-03 16:40:56	mmchugh	justinabrahms: you're on the internet. I think that means you are required to judge.

2014-01-04 12:37:40	bitprophet	that said...the mifi I was using was really flaky, maybe a non flaky one would have sucked less
2014-01-04 12:38:08	bitprophet	that also said, I haven't had to do (m)any Big Serious Incidents over the tether either, cuz ssh kinda sucks

2014-01-04 12:38:46	 *	bitprophet drops $20 of change into scottjab's thoughts jar
2014-01-04 12:38:57	dcolish	well the mifi is free soooo
2014-01-04 12:39:13	scottjab	well I don't use the work one cus I just have my own
2014-01-04 12:39:17	scottjab	I have always had my own
2014-01-04 12:39:48	dcolish	i have a pretty strict policy of not using personal resources for work
2014-01-04 12:39:59	bitprophet	I have the opposite
2014-01-04 12:40:07	dcolish	i got burnt a lot when i was a photo assistant
2014-01-04 12:40:14	bitprophet	having to manage my life across two sets of devices has always been a horrible experience
2014-01-04 12:40:17	scottjab	yea
2014-01-04 12:40:30	bitprophet	I also try not to work for places where I would have to seriously worry about IP pollution
2014-01-04 12:40:41	scottjab	I think I am going to do it, cus target will give me 200 bux in giftcards for my ipad 1 that is pretty much a heavy kindle at this point
2014-01-04 12:40:52	bitprophet	(that is even acknowledging the fact that even if you have "a cool boss" you can still get fucked over by legal)
2014-01-04 12:41:05	bitprophet	wait what
2014-01-04 12:41:05	dcolish	the only thing my personal and work systems share are my dotfiles
2014-01-04 12:41:14	bitprophet	target gives you $$$ish for an ipad 1?
2014-01-04 12:41:19	bitprophet	cuz I have an ipad 1 gathering dust
2014-01-04 12:41:19	scottjab	yea
2014-01-04 12:41:22	scottjab	any old idevice
2014-01-04 12:41:22	dcolish	thats cool

2014-01-04 12:41:29	scottjab	http://www.targettradeinprogram.com/
2014-01-04 12:41:30	dcolish	i should tell my dad
2014-01-04 12:41:30	dcolish	he's got an old one
2014-01-04 12:43:32	dcolish	bitprophet: its more about physical resources that i dont like to mix
2014-01-04 12:44:10	bitprophet	dcolish: how so?
2014-01-04 12:44:15	scottjab	they just quoted me 58 bux
2014-01-04 12:44:18	scottjab	which is better than nothing
2014-01-04 12:44:27	bitprophet	dcolish: meaning e.g. your shit on their hard drive or vice versa?
2014-01-04 12:44:34	dcolish	for example, the fact that i am required to use my personal cellphone as my contact device for oncall is not something i love
2014-01-04 12:44:37	dcolish	its the cost
2014-01-04 12:44:40	bitprophet	ah
2014-01-04 12:44:43	dcolish	i pay for my cellphone
2014-01-04 12:44:51	dcolish	doubly so for the mifi
2014-01-04 12:44:55	scottjab	you can write it off too
2014-01-04 12:44:59	bitprophet	yea I'm not a huge fan of having to put a $10/mo txt plan on my line just for pagerduty. but eh. I get 8% off my bill cuz of UA anyway, so.
2014-01-04 12:45:22	bitprophet	re: computers tho, using my kit I would already be lugging around, for work, at the office, is a win-win imho
2014-01-04 12:45:47	bitprophet	I don't do the "use office computer as your personal laptop" thing tho, some people do, I don't get it
2014-01-04 12:45:59	bitprophet	cuz then they're totally in their rights to ask for it back
2014-01-04 12:46:08	dcolish	yeah i used to do that at idealist and it was a bad choice
2014-01-04 12:46:13	dcolish	now i have my own personal laptop
2014-01-04 12:46:22	bitprophet	mm
2014-01-04 12:46:24	dcolish	i do all my personal dev on it too
2014-01-04 12:47:12	dcolish	honestly, i've never really been worried about the IP argument based on what system you wrote the code on
2014-01-04 12:47:47	bitprophet	right
2014-01-04 12:47:58	dcolish	i think your employer can claim a lot of liberties with new stuff you write as their employee regardless of what system you wrote it on
2014-01-04 12:47:58	bitprophet	scottjab: yea $58 for mine too (baseline ipad 1)
2014-01-04 12:48:08	bitprophet	dcolish: definitely true
2014-01-04 12:48:18	dcolish	thankfully most dont bother

2014-01-04 17:06:33	mmchugh	So I took it to the store and they eventually actvated it for me
2014-01-04 17:06:43	schmichael	Maybe I'll just drive to walmart :(
2014-01-04 17:07:17	mmchugh	I went to the walmart on 82nd when I got mine
2014-01-04 17:07:26	mmchugh	And they don't have full sized kits
2014-01-04 17:07:32	schmichael	full sized?
2014-01-04 17:07:36	mmchugh	At least not when I went (they only had micro sim)
2014-01-04 17:07:43	mmchugh	ie, iphone sims
2014-01-04 17:07:47	schmichael	ah
2014-01-04 17:07:51	schmichael	i think micro is what i need
2014-01-04 17:08:02	schmichael	yeah, not full, not nano. micro
2014-01-04 17:08:06	schmichael	well, i guess i'll try that
2014-01-04 17:08:14	mmchugh	Well then might be worth a shot. :)
2014-01-04 17:08:15	schmichael	since i don't know what state the tmob reps left my account in!
2014-01-04 17:08:20	mmchugh	haha

2014-01-04 18:02:50	schmichael	mmchugh: when you said they were out of 1 kind my response should have been to call ahead and make sure they had the other...
2014-01-04 18:02:55	schmichael	mmchugh: ...because they did not
2014-01-04 18:03:09	mmchugh	:(
2014-01-04 18:03:10	schmichael	i think i'm just going to order a damn sim online
2014-01-04 18:03:19	mmchugh	Aww
2014-01-04 18:03:40	schmichael	one interesting thing i learned is that walmart has a $40/mo. plan that's unlimited everything... which is tempting except for the part where i'd be giving walmart money regularly
2014-01-04 18:03:45	schmichael	it just goes through tmobiles network
2014-01-04 18:03:48	schmichael	*shrug*
2014-01-04 18:03:55	 *	schmichael goes and orders a sim from tmob
2014-01-04 18:06:13	schmichael	hold on... what does this mean? Note:This item is not eligible for a monthly payment plan
2014-01-04 18:06:28	schmichael	is "monthly payment plan" the opposite of prepaid?
2014-01-04 18:07:22	mmchugh	I... guess? I don't know. :(
2014-01-04 18:07:39	kdj	You should probably call them up and find out
2014-01-04 18:07:46	mmchugh	I thought cell companies in Canada were bad, but then I had to deal with ones here
2014-01-04 18:07:50	kdj	I'm sure that will be easy and straight-forward
2014-01-04 18:08:07	mmchugh	At least in Canada all we have to deal with is collusion and price fixing
2014-01-04 18:11:46	ericholscher	finally figured out how to do a clean install of OSX Mavericks, and its like a breathe of fresh air
2014-01-04 18:11:50	schmichael	the live chat is now broken in both my chrome profiles but still works in private browsing modes
2014-01-04 18:11:52	ericholscher	so nice to get rid of all my random cruft
2014-01-04 18:14:10	kdj	schmichael: They're slowly determining you're a problem customer and "breaking" your cookies

2014-01-04 18:14:25	schmichael	kdj: the problem with calling them is the misinformation the reps give me :(
2014-01-04 18:14:41	schmichael	it's just kind of luck whether the rep knows any more than i do
2014-01-04 18:15:08	kdj	Yep!
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	if i'm unlucky my current plan will go inactive in the next 24 hours, and i'll have no phone
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	and/or i won't be able to return this worthless sim the store sold me
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	according to this tmob rep, the sims sold on their site do *not* work with the $30/mo. plan...
2014-01-04 18:20:33	kdj	So only the sims that you can't buy work
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	exactly
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	they sell prepaid and postpaid sims online, but not prepaid sims for *this* plan
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	according to this rep
2014-01-04 18:20:33	schmichael	i'm almost positive everyone else on this plan just ordered a sim off the site
2014-01-04 18:21:19	schmichael	fuck me! the walmart sim is $40! http://www.walmart.com/ip/T-Mobile-SIM-Kit/24099996
2014-01-04 18:27:33	mmchugh	That includes the first month

2014-01-05 22:33:45	vitaminmoo	and the recommended course of action was a bath in tomato juice

2014-01-05 22:38:41	kdj	Most recommendations were a mixture of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide and dish soap
2014-01-05 22:38:44	ericholscher	i'm back on PST in EST again :x
2014-01-05 22:38:50	kdj	So that happened
2014-01-05 22:38:53	vitaminmoo	kdj: at least, if you heat it up enough with the pup in it, you got a stew goin'
2014-01-05 22:39:18	kdj	Can't let a good dog go to waste
2014-01-05 22:39:26	vitaminmoo	stew ain't waste
2014-01-05 22:39:33	kdj	Thats what I mean
2014-01-05 22:39:39	kdj	Why your solution is reasonable
2014-01-05 22:39:48	vitaminmoo	if it were a pug you coul dhave an excess of charcuterie
2014-01-05 22:39:59	vitaminmoo	dem cheek meats
2014-01-05 22:40:22	kdj	The best part is the entire house smells so badly it is impossible to tell if any possible solution has worked
2014-01-05 22:40:45	kdj	Its a good thing schmichael has to sit near me
2014-01-05 22:40:51	bitprophet	kdj: condolences, our dogs got skunked on the regular back when I was a kid
2014-01-05 22:41:19	kdj	I almost walked directly into it again while talking the dog to the garage, too
2014-01-05 22:41:20	vitaminmoo	kdj: if they layed down on stuff that stuff is going to be skunky for a long time :(O
2014-01-05 22:41:24	kdj	So that would have been fantastic
2014-01-05 22:41:27	bitprophet	of course they also got into neighbors' compost heaps, and rolled around on dead things, about as often, which only smelled slightly better
2014-01-05 22:41:47	kdj	vitaminmoo: We caught him before he came inside
2014-01-05 22:42:11	kdj	So if the million baths I just gave him helped at all, it will be slightly better. But not much.
2014-01-05 22:42:57	vitaminmoo	kdj: :/
2014-01-05 22:43:00	vitaminmoo	kdj: good luck :/

2014-01-06 11:16:54	maaaaaaaaaarc	it was wonderful
2014-01-06 11:16:59	jefftowle	if NPR goes, so go the totebag manufacturers
2014-01-06 11:17:09	schmichael	maaaaaaaaaarc: amazing
2014-01-06 11:17:45	maaaaaaaaaarc	it passed the blind taste test, evidently
2014-01-06 11:17:53	pfd	The great thing about NPR is that they taught us to think of our monthly expenditures in terms of the number of fancy coffee drinks one could reasonably forgo.
2014-01-06 11:18:45	jefftowle	bitcoin is currently at 250 lattes
2014-01-06 11:20:08	pfd	how many cigarettes is that?

2014-01-06 11:23:21	jefftowle	it's hard to part them out, so it'd be tough to use them as currency
2014-01-06 11:23:36	jefftowle	true

2014-01-06 11:29:05	gmcquillan	Yes, but what kind of latte.
2014-01-06 11:29:17	gmcquillan	Some are $2, some are $4.50.
2014-01-06 11:29:19	luckythetourist	the cock and balls latte
2014-01-06 11:29:25	gmcquillan	That's a pretty big spread for such an important commodity.
2014-01-06 11:29:26	luckythetourist	it's quite nice

2014-01-06 13:39:33	gmcquillan	After setting up the attrs dict one line at a time.
2014-01-06 13:39:35	gmcquillan	It's like they didn't know Models don't save anything until you call .save().
2014-01-06 13:46:01	dcolish	couldnt you just use Model.objects.get(pk)?
