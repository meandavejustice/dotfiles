2013-10-21 14:26:19	JSON_voorhees	of course
2013-10-21 14:26:30	JSON_voorhees	god I'm loving emacs
2013-10-21 14:26:34	cam_stitt	It's amazeballs

2013-10-21 14:26:45	cam_stitt	i have  github repo
2013-10-21 14:26:48	JSON_voorhees	I wanna fi a couple more little things
2013-10-21 14:26:56	JSON_voorhees	cool I'll check it out
2013-10-21 14:27:02	cam_stitt	https://github.com/cam-stitt/dotfiles
2013-10-21 14:28:18	JSON_voorhees	oh yours is nice and organized with each package setting in another file
2013-10-21 14:28:24	cam_stitt	;)
2013-10-21 14:28:31	cam_stitt	I like neat things
2013-10-21 14:28:52	JSON_voorhees	me too, just haven't had the time. I've been changing too much in there
2013-10-21 14:29:02	cam_stitt	Yeah, I am glad I did this though
2013-10-21 14:29:11	cam_stitt	if I want to remove a package
2013-10-21 14:29:13	cam_stitt	i comment out 1 line
2013-10-21 14:30:07	JSON_voorhees	https://gist.github.com/meandavejustice/7091347
2013-10-21 14:30:17	JSON_voorhees	yeah I need to do that I think 
2013-10-21 14:30:53	cam_stitt	If you wanted to try my dotfiles, you can just clone and run it
2013-10-21 14:30:57	cam_stitt	0 extra work required
2013-10-21 14:31:27	JSON_voorhees	yeah I need to add a file for installing all of my packages.
2013-10-21 14:31:40	JSON_voorhees	I have a couple I don't have settings for that I just invoke when I want
2013-10-21 14:31:49	cam_stitt	I install each package in teh setup file for it
2013-10-21 14:31:59	cam_stitt	so again, i can just comment out one line
2013-10-21 14:32:07	JSON_voorhees	yeah I like taht
2013-10-21 14:32:15	cam_stitt	Check out that projectile package though
2013-10-21 14:32:21	cam_stitt	give you a find file feature in a git repo
2013-10-21 14:32:29	cam_stitt	and other things, but that is the key for me
2013-10-21 14:32:37	JSON_voorhees	that sounds super nice!
2013-10-21 14:32:48	JSON_voorhees	magit is the SHIT! too
2013-10-21 14:32:53	cam_stitt	I don't use magit much yet
2013-10-21 14:32:57	cam_stitt	need to force myself to use it
2013-10-21 14:33:00	JSON_voorhees	u will
2013-10-21 14:33:04	cam_stitt	also, sr-speedbar is awesome
2013-10-21 14:33:08	JSON_voorhees	the key is to keep a magit buffer open
2013-10-21 14:33:13	cam_stitt	Yeah, i'll start doing that
2013-10-21 14:33:30	JSON_voorhees	you can do all diffs, big comparisions, list branches, status, everything
2013-10-21 14:37:10	cam_stitt	what magit buffer do you have open
2013-10-21 14:37:12	cam_stitt	not magit-status?
2013-10-21 14:39:21	JSON_voorhees	lemme check
2013-10-21 14:40:26	JSON_voorhees	status is okay, but I should keep branches open too probably
2013-10-21 14:40:29	JSON_voorhees	personally
2013-10-21 14:40:37	cam_stitt	no idea how
2013-10-21 14:40:53	cam_stitt	magit-branch-manager?
2013-10-21 14:42:04	JSON_voorhees	i guess so?
2013-10-21 14:42:09	cam_stitt	rofl
2013-10-21 14:42:27	JSON_voorhees	I haven't kept that one open yet
2013-10-21 14:42:38	JSON_voorhees	I've just been using the auto-complete minibuffer
2013-10-21 14:43:08	cam_stitt	eh?
2013-10-21 14:43:13	JSON_voorhees	still not comfortable with minibuffers though, I end up just getting frustrated and escaping out of them haha
2013-10-21 14:43:30	cam_stitt	not sure what minibuffers are
2013-10-21 14:43:39	cam_stitt	i pretty much just have 4 panes of files and then sr-speedbar open
2013-10-21 14:48:10	JSON_voorhees	how do you feel about how emacs handles tabs?
2013-10-21 14:48:24	cam_stitt	indentation? I like it
2013-10-21 14:48:32	cam_stitt	especially python files
2013-10-21 14:48:46	cam_stitt	I had some issues with js
2013-10-21 14:48:50	cam_stitt	but i fixed it using js2-mode
2013-10-21 14:49:26	cam_stitt	https://github.com/cam-stitt/dotfiles/blob/master/setup-js-mode.el#L6
2013-10-21 14:49:30	JSON_voorhees	cool yeah, that's what I'm using. a little weird to get used to but Im liking it
2013-10-21 16:15:48	cam_stitt	Can't use zsh nicely in emacs shell
2013-10-21 16:15:49	cam_stitt	blegh

2013-10-22 15:50:24	JSON_voorhees	you don't wanna brag about your .emacs at simple?
2013-10-22 15:50:40	cam_stitt	Haha, I want to do some more work on my project

2013-10-22 15:55:29	JSON_voorhees	although I probably won't be writing any python :))
2013-10-22 15:55:38	cam_stitt	All good
2013-10-22 16:00:05	JSON_voorhees	just found something cool, if you edit some files in another branch/editor and need to get ALL open buffers up to date just M-x global-auto-revert-mode
2013-10-22 16:00:21	JSON_voorhees	and M-x revert-buffer for just the one buffer
2013-10-22 16:00:49	cam_stitt	nice
2013-10-22 16:10:38	cam_stitt	This is out btw
2013-10-22 16:10:39	cam_stitt	https://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-twitter-flight/book
2013-10-22 16:34:53	JSON_voorhees	y didn't u write that
2013-10-22 16:35:06	cam_stitt	cause i don't know it enough
2013-10-22 16:35:12	cam_stitt	the guy that did works at twitter, so he does know it
2013-10-22 16:35:17	cam_stitt	i'm reading it now
2013-10-22 16:35:22	JSON_voorhees	oh nice

2013-10-22 17:07:29	JSON_voorhees	that's awesome
2013-10-22 17:16:35	cam_stitt	Btw, this is a great summary of why I like flight.
2013-10-22 17:16:38	cam_stitt	In Flight, each component has a clear, well-defined interface and is essentially unaware of the existence of the rest of the application. A component acts as an independent entity and will continue to work as intended if all other components on the site are removed.
2013-10-22 17:16:38	cam_stitt	These simple, well-defined interfaces can be exhaustively tested, ensuring that each component behaves in a predictable manner. This makes it possible to rapidly develop new features by reusing existing components and mixins, safe in the knowledge that they will behave as expected in their new environment.

2013-10-23 11:04:09	JSON_voorhees	yeah man, it's really frustration to come up with ideas sometimes
2013-10-23 11:04:32	JSON_voorhees	I keep a gist bookmarked where write down all ideas of stuff i want to build
2013-10-23 11:04:54	JSON_voorhees	even if it's something I know I won't work on for a while
2013-10-23 11:05:15	JSON_voorhees	then when I'm really itching to work on something I just pick something from their
2013-10-23 11:06:01	JSON_voorhees	cus sometimes your just in a mood to build shit. it's a different mindset
