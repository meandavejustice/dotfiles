2013-07-10 11:51:25	@justinabrahms	I don't know how to deal with human emotions and I fear confrontation/taking responsibility for my actions, therefore I'll murder someone rather than making them sad.

2013-07-10 12:58:14	@JSON_voorhees	that was a paste from top
2013-07-10 12:58:25	@JSON_voorhees	which is really hard to copy from :/
2013-07-10 13:08:18	jstanton	odd... I pulled master down and I'm getting a "No module named oboe" error so I pip installed oboe and it's still complaining, so I stopped the server, reran make settings, and restarted the server... same error.  any thoughts?
2013-07-10 13:08:42	jstanton	I didnt think I needed to manually add things to the python path
2013-07-10 13:09:25	@jstump	No idea.
2013-07-10 13:09:26	@jstump	WFM
2013-07-10 13:09:43	@jstump	But then again your local env is a pretty spectacular dragon's layer so who knows.
2013-07-10 13:11:05	@jstump	Is your virtualenv activated?
2013-07-10 13:11:13	@jstump	Did you install *while in your virtualenv*?
2013-07-10 13:11:16	@jstump	Or did you install globally?
2013-07-10 13:11:27	@justinabrahms	jstanton: paste error to gist and link it?
2013-07-10 13:11:38	@justinabrahms	installing oboe will give a faux error, but does install correctly.
2013-07-10 13:11:50	@justinabrahms	(at least on OSX)
2013-07-10 13:12:05	@jstump	justinabrahms: H'es on a Ubuntu server so he should be able to install the whole thing and use it if he really wanted to.
2013-07-10 13:12:14	@justinabrahms	also, no mucking around with your python path should be necessary.

2013-07-10 13:12:43	@jstump	Sorry.
2013-07-10 13:12:58	@jstump	justinabrahms: There are 0 things stopping you from setting up a local Ubuntu server on VirtualBox.

2013-07-10 13:13:46	jstanton	I have a walkthrough to get you up and running ubuntu-wise
2013-07-10 13:14:01	@JSON_voorhees	justinabrahms remap it
2013-07-10 13:14:07	@jstump	OS X last I checked that was a VirtualBox configuration setting.
2013-07-10 13:14:12	jstanton	get virtual box and the latest ubuntu iso and you'll be up anbd running in an hour or less.
2013-07-10 13:14:24	 *	justinabrahms might try it this weekend.
2013-07-10 13:14:31	@justinabrahms	jstanton: are you in a virtualenv?
2013-07-10 13:14:38	jstanton	where should I stick the walkthrough doc?
2013-07-10 13:14:41	jstanton	yessir
2013-07-10 13:14:52	@justinabrahms	pip install oboe
2013-07-10 13:14:59	jstanton	I tried it both ways.. first in virtual and then not
2013-07-10 13:15:01	@justinabrahms	gist? I'm familiar enough with the setup that I don't think there will be any surprises.
2013-07-10 13:15:15	@justinabrahms	basically the only thing that should be installed outside of a virtualenv is pip and virtualenv.
2013-07-10 13:15:25	@JSON_voorhees	have you tried just doing pip install -r requirements/development.txt? could it just be a version thang?

2013-07-10 13:18:09	jstanton	Justin: that setup is very me specific so make sure you change all the passwords and what not... come to think of it I should have sterilized it before posting to git

2013-07-10 16:46:52	@JSON_voorhees	jstanton: reviewing your changes on staging. I'm actually seeing the style differences..
2013-07-10 16:47:10	@JSON_voorhees	for some reason they weren't showing up locally.
2013-07-10 16:47:28	@JSON_voorhees	I'm going to back it out and get them styles to match, then I'll merge again :)
2013-07-10 17:16:52	jstanton	I got them close... but I'm not enough of a designer to work out the issues it was having with the top and bottom borders
2013-07-10 17:17:17	jstanton	especially since the styling changes subtly when you scrolled and the drop down repositioned and restyled itself
2013-07-10 17:17:31	jstump	jstanton: In the future, reach out to Grant or David to rectify before pulling a PR. PRs that regress design/UI/UX will almost always be rejected. 
2013-07-10 17:18:06	@JSON_voorhees	jstump: i actually merged it, It turns out I was reviewing in the wrong branch :(
2013-07-10 17:18:26	jstump	JSON_voorhees: we might have to revoke your merge rights. ;)
2013-07-10 17:19:28	@JSON_voorhees	:)
2013-07-10 17:19:35	jstanton	It felt close enough not to matter but I'm hardly the UI czar.
2013-07-10 17:20:00	jstanton	well at least the border stylings I was obsessing over
2013-07-10 17:20:13	jstanton	the text size and default values probably needed tweaking now that I think on it.
2013-07-10 17:20:26	jstanton	or rather not the default values but their appearance
2013-07-10 17:22:07	jstanton	so who is the final word on style/UI?
2013-07-10 17:22:21	@JSON_voorhees	me or grant
2013-07-10 17:22:34	@JSON_voorhees	when I checkout the corrent branch that is
2013-07-10 17:22:38	jstanton	ok cool.
2013-07-10 17:22:39	jstanton	lol
2013-07-10 17:22:46	jstump	It's pretty simple: The UI/styles you see should be maintained unless the ticket says otherwise. 
2013-07-10 17:23:21	jstump	We're obsessive about those design details here. So if it's not the same, it's not correct. Now if it's a UI/UX issue you'd like to resolve, we're always happy to discuss. 
2013-07-10 17:25:03	jstanton	so JSON it sounded like you were going to make the changes.  It's my ticket so did you mean that I'd be doing it? The sentence was unclear.
2013-07-10 17:27:52	jstanton	The text sizing and default values can be fixed easily but sizing and coloring the 1px borders on the top and bottom are going to be a challenge, since the approach they use in select2 is new to me.  I'll ask the goog.
2013-07-10 17:28:47	@JSON_voorhees	you can if you'd like
2013-07-10 17:29:28	@JSON_voorhees	its up to you, If you feel like its taking you a long time or your having to be really hacky about it, feel free to assign it to me
2013-07-10 17:29:50	jstanton	let me do what I know I can do easily and then I'll pass the baton.  sound good?
2013-07-10 17:30:02	@JSON_voorhees	yezzir
2013-07-10 17:31:28	jstanton	what time zone are you in?
2013-07-10 17:33:16	jstanton	If you need it tonight I can knock it out.  But it's late enough I'd like to call it a night and spend some time with the Mrs.
2013-07-10 17:33:54	@JSON_voorhees	jstanton: your fine, we don't need it tonight
2013-07-10 17:34:08	@JSON_voorhees	I'm in pdx

2013-07-11 10:30:49	nicholasserra	But I'm just having inconsistent problems with how i'm removing items from the columns views in general. And then add local storage on top of that and it's just not consistent.

This distinction is to allow for where some form of mapping mechanism might be used to distribute requests across multiple process groups and thus in effect it is still a multiprocess application. If you nee
2013-07-11 10:36:01	@jstump	I think this is a major problem. Haha.
2013-07-11 10:36:04	@jstump	We don't specify that.
2013-07-11 10:36:57	nicholasserra	jstump: I think I just need some local testers in that branch. Maybe some of the frontend guys, JSON_voorhees specifically might be able to see if I have a disconnect somewhere. The main issue is just removing items from the columns view on bulk move.
2013-07-11 10:39:04	@jstump	nicholasserra: But you said the BE is returning bad data?
2013-07-11 10:39:15	@jstump	nicholasserra: No amount of FE debugging will fix a BE bug. 
2013-07-11 10:40:44	nicholasserra	I'm going to get a solid answer on that right now. A runserver restart corrects it for me, that's why I initially thought it was a caching issue.
2013-07-11 10:41:21	nicholasserra	But sometimes the way I'm removing items from columns just straight doesn't work for me using the standard methods.
2013-07-11 10:41:45	nicholasserra	I'm pretty confident that it's only a FE issue. 
2013-07-11 10:42:55	nicholasserra	It's odd because it's like 85% flawless for me. Just the inconsistencies that are driving me crazy.

2013-07-11 11:22:18	jstanton	The way select2 matches is a good bit different.  I prefer it but I'd like your thoughts.
2013-07-11 11:23:34	@justinabrahms	Can I merge https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/pull/436 into billing-interstitial
2013-07-11 11:23:35	@justinabrahms	?
2013-07-11 11:23:52	jstanton	I'm adding in some code to cover field aliases (so "me" matches), but beyond that it matches from the beginning I think rather than within the user name... let me confirm.

2013-07-11 11:26:42	jstanton	ah ok
2013-07-11 11:27:39	jstanton	ok got it... it matches any string fragments rather than from the beginning of the name.  We probably want that to stay the same now that I think on it.
2013-07-11 11:31:37	jstanton	but the highlight on matched letters is a yellow that's very hard to see... are we ok with changing that to an underline?
2013-07-11 11:31:43	jstanton	or no?

2013-07-15 10:44:20	nicholasserra	You remake js?
2013-07-15 10:44:20	jstanton	I remake settings.py but nothing js-wise
2013-07-15 10:44:20	nicholasserra	I'm assuming you have DEBUG_JS to True. 
2013-07-15 10:44:42	jstanton	I'm lost. elaborate.
2013-07-15 10:45:41	jstanton	So far when I'm making js changes it's all reflected automatically
2013-07-15 10:45:48	jstanton	I havent made any python changes as yet
2013-07-15 10:46:11	nicholasserra	We run 'make js' to recompile all of the javscript. The django settings.py i think is set to default run everything off the built js. I'm just assuming at this point you do all of that already. Theres a flag in settings.py DEBUG_JS that toggles whether or not you are running off the build js or the static js directory. 
2013-07-15 10:46:31	jstanton	let me check
2013-07-15 10:46:46	nicholasserra	I just wanted to make sure your local js was up to date and you weren't running off the built js, because that isn't under version control.
2013-07-15 10:53:08	jstanton	nicholasserra: I must be missing something. It's still not working locally.  Would you mind looking over my shoulder to help determine what I'm missing?
2013-07-15 10:54:09	nicholasserra	I could have something messed up too. All I did was fetch upstream, get my master up to date. The run make js to be safe, clear all cache, and tested it out.
2013-07-15 10:55:04	jstanton	google hangout? shouldnt take but a minute
2013-07-15 10:55:35	nicholasserra	Sounds good, i'm available now
2013-07-15 10:57:01	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: sorry I didnt get your first mention on that item...
2013-07-15 10:57:17	jstanton	no worries
2013-07-15 10:57:19	nicholasserra	No prob. Can we discuss in here in a few?
2013-07-15 10:57:24	jstanton	sending you a hangout invite
2013-07-15 10:57:25	jstanton	sure
2013-07-15 10:57:26	JSON_voorhees	no problem
2013-07-15 10:57:28	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees
2013-07-15 10:58:02	jstanton	google says you're offline.  gimme some love!
2013-07-15 10:58:38	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: let me find the command for running functional tests locally
2013-07-15 10:58:59	jstanton	nicholasserra: is now a bad time after all? the goog says you're offline...
2013-07-15 10:59:01	nicholasserra	jstanton: Ugh installing
2013-07-15 10:59:19	jstanton	nicholasserra: I can use some other tool if you have a preference
2013-07-15 10:59:52	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: to run functional tests =>> `grunt local-tests:all:chrome`
2013-07-15 11:18:02	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: Awesome. Does any other related data need to be added aside from the test product?
2013-07-15 11:18:56	jstanton	justinabrahms: a word, señor, when you have a moment.
2013-07-15 11:20:20	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: Nah we just need to have that product be a high enough number so that it won't be overridden
2013-07-15 11:20:21	jstanton	justinabrahms: nick confirmed I took appropriate steps to make sure I was in sync data and code wise and I'm still not seeing the favorite fix locally but we both see it in production.  I'd like to mark the ticket unreproducable but wanted your opinion on if that was ok process wise 
2013-07-15 11:21:07	jstanton	justinabrahms: actually I'm going to assume yes, and you can tell me to undo that change on the ticket if you want later.
2013-07-15 11:21:15	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: once that product is in place I'll make sure that we properly create all the test items we need and delete them while running tests :)
2013-07-15 11:21:20	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: Thinking he might have a pusher connection problem locally. Is production deployed recently?
2013-07-15 11:22:12	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: Okay, i'll be doing that today. Does the grunt test take a product_id as a parameter, or how does it know which one to use?
2013-07-15 11:22:36	JSON_voorhees	you will have to go into the functional tests and change the pid in the url
2013-07-15 11:22:45	JSON_voorhees	I'll send u a gist hold on
2013-07-15 11:23:24	nicholasserra	Okay. So whats the ideal way to make this all work? if I make a python manage.py command to make a test product with an ID, how will the grunt test know which one to use?
2013-07-15 11:24:14	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra
2013-07-15 11:24:23	JSON_voorhees	https://gist.github.com/meandavejustice/0fd89c94e898461ae0f7
2013-07-15 11:24:45	JSON_voorhees	grunt doesn't know about it at all, they will be hardcoded in the test for now
2013-07-15 11:24:58	JSON_voorhees	we may change that down the road... but for now it is fine.
2013-07-15 11:25:11	nicholasserra	Hm, okay. Well then I guess i'll make it default to some crazy high number
2013-07-15 11:25:18	nicholasserra	But optionally take an ID
2013-07-15 11:25:35	JSON_voorhees	and if tests don't all pass don't worry about it, it will be my job to make sure they are all working
2013-07-15 11:25:45	JSON_voorhees	that sounds great
2013-07-15 11:26:33	@justinabrahms	jstanton: if you can't reproduce it, calling it "can't reproduce" is fine. If a customer complained about it, @ mention jason and tell him if he hears about it again, let you know.
2013-07-15 11:26:51	@justinabrahms	nicholasserra: production was deployed this morning, I think.
2013-07-15 11:27:07	@justinabrahms	caliper.io integration broke some stuff, so I think we rolled back this morning.
2013-07-15 11:29:20	nicholasserra	:-/
2013-07-15 11:30:11	jstanton	justinabrahms: cool.
2013-07-15 11:32:01	jstanton	justinabrahms: re: "cant reproduce", not having to roll back.  that sucks.

2013-07-15 12:28:19	nicholasserra	JSON_voorhees: Also, might want to change those functional tests to use a common variable for product_id since i'll be generating one with "99999999" by default

2013-07-15 13:21:32	@justinabrahms	I think Joe might be working on that, however, so check with him.

2013-07-15 15:48:44	JSON_voorhees	nicholasserra: I went ahead and just added my changes in pr along with changes to get functional tests running, so I'm just gunna close your pr. 
2013-07-15 15:53:31	@justinabrahms	ubuntu VM is officially a failed experiment. Virtualbox IO is slow, system was dragging, dealing with too many disk-space issues.
2013-07-15 15:55:14	JSON_voorhees	:(
2013-07-15 16:03:44	jstanton	you think?
2013-07-15 16:04:10	jstanton	I am running on SSDs with a fixed size drive for my ubuntu VM and it runs relatively fine
2013-07-15 16:04:38	jstanton	It just feels like a somewhat slow connection but other than when I completely reload the page it runs fine.
2013-07-15 16:04:54	@justinabrahms	*shrug* personal experience on a machine with SSDs, 16GB ram (8 allocated to VM)
2013-07-15 16:05:10	jstanton	well hell we sound the exact same
2013-07-15 16:05:13	jstanton	:-/
2013-07-15 16:05:28	jstanton	that's odd that it's so different
2013-07-15 16:05:55	jstanton	did you set the VM drive to be fixed size?
2013-07-15 16:06:06	jstanton	you get a noticable performance increase when you do that
2013-07-15 16:06:17	jstanton	I set mine to 40GB
2013-07-15 16:06:49	jstanton	I think I only have 4GB ram allocated, not that that should matter
2013-07-15 16:09:21	jstanton	heading out for dinner. back in a few hours

2013-07-16 12:15:03	@justinabrahms	That seems problematic.
2013-07-16 12:15:04	nicholasserra	I'm trying to decide a reliable way to bail on them if the request is ajax.
2013-07-16 12:15:20	nicholasserra	I might check path info in request.
2013-07-16 12:15:21	nicholasserra	    'path_info': u '/ajax/wasatch/filter_items.json',
2013-07-16 12:15:22	@justinabrahms	I'm not clear why they even get evaluated. That should only happen in the tempting layer, no?
2013-07-16 12:15:46	nicholasserra	That's what I thought but I'm seeing some calls elsewhere. Maybe I have something messed up. I'm digging in it.

2013-07-18 13:50:05	jstump	I just realized the cabin I might go in on with my pops in Michigan would require $15k less capital than my car cost me.

2013-07-19 16:08:23	JSON_voorhees	wookiehangover: you ever dealt with command-clicks in chrome?
2013-07-19 16:09:01	JSON_voorhees	since we do navigation with urlchange it wont open a new tab, although it does work in all other browsers
2013-07-19 16:09:11	wookiehangover	in general, yes, can't recall chrome issues specifically tho
2013-07-19 16:09:17	JSON_voorhees	also Welcome to the sprint.ly irc
2013-07-19 16:09:39	wookiehangover	oh, interesting
2013-07-19 16:12:48	wookiehangover	so you could always have a check for the event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey if you're capturing click events
2013-07-19 16:12:54	wookiehangover	and then do a window.open
2013-07-19 16:12:57	JSON_voorhees	ahh
2013-07-19 16:13:06	wookiehangover	but that's kludge-y
2013-07-19 16:13:18	JSON_voorhees	yeah, I was trying to figure out a way to trigger a new tab for those instances
2013-07-19 16:13:27	JSON_voorhees	I was checking for e.metaKey...
2013-07-19 16:13:46	JSON_voorhees	but I was trying to see if there was a "handle this like a normal link" thing in chrome
2013-07-19 16:13:49	wookiehangover	I usually use the Backbone boilerplate capture all clicks method anyway: https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate/blob/master/app/main.js#L22-L39
2013-07-19 16:13:50	JSON_voorhees	err in backbone
2013-07-19 16:18:52	JSON_voorhees	thats a good setup, I was thinking about setting something like that up
2013-07-19 16:20:45	wookiehangover	so I like to have an "app view" that uses $('body') as it's `el` specifically for doing stuff like that
2013-07-19 16:24:39	JSON_voorhees	yeah that sounds nice, we are binding to 'navigate' 'change:anchor' events

2013-07-22 14:29:50	nicholasserra	Yadah: Didn't try it, but on windows it says "CTRL+Enter" in the item dialog. So I'm thinking it's supposed to.

2013-07-23 09:09:45	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: Do you want me to start doing elasticsearch stuff?
2013-07-23 09:09:56	nicholasserra	Or are there any other bugs, random stuff that need done
2013-07-23 09:10:19	justinabrahms	let me take a look
2013-07-23 09:10:35	nicholasserra	Or more query auditing.
2013-07-23 09:11:19	justinabrahms	We're probably nearing diminishing returns for query optimization (for now)
2013-07-23 09:13:00	justinabrahms	so your choice: get some visibility into our queuing behavior or write a search backend
2013-07-23 09:14:04	justinabrahms	where "get some visibility" means:   I want to know the percentile time each queue job takes and rough percentages of messages in flight so I know what the cause of our queue backup errors are
2013-07-23 09:14:18	justinabrahms	and I have a few thoughts for search backend too, if you want to do that one.
2013-07-23 09:16:17	nicholasserra	Does tracelytics not monitor the celery tasks?
2013-07-23 09:17:22	nicholasserra	Have you seen this celery "flower"?
2013-07-23 09:17:23	nicholasserra	http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#flower-real-time-celery-web-monitor
2013-07-23 09:18:18	justinabrahms	not seen that, no.
2013-07-23 09:18:38	justinabrahms	I don't think tracelytics monitors celery.
2013-07-23 09:19:08	nicholasserra	Maybe we can get them talking. 
2013-07-23 09:19:22	nicholasserra	But flower looks cool, but it's another thing running. Not sure if we want to go that route.
2013-07-23 09:20:08	justinabrahms	I'm less interested in that.
2013-07-23 09:20:12	justinabrahms	we do have a statsd server setup
2013-07-23 09:20:19	justinabrahms	(though tracelytics would be nicer)
2013-07-23 09:21:06	justinabrahms	tracelytics celery integration is about monitoring the queue processing code: http://www.appneta.com/2012/07/16/tracing-celery-performance/
2013-07-23 09:21:21	justinabrahms	not about the characteristics of in-flight messages (which seems more important to me)
2013-07-23 09:22:05	justinabrahms	though perhaps one informs the other. Slow processing jobs == queue backup.
2013-07-23 09:22:15	nicholasserra	Right.
2013-07-23 09:22:18	justinabrahms	if you're down to add in the tracelytics instrumentation they mention there, that'd be helpful.
2013-07-23 09:22:26	nicholasserra	Ill check that out.
2013-07-23 09:22:35	justinabrahms	https://sprint.ly/product/1/#!/item/3768/
2013-07-23 09:22:36	nicholasserra	Isn't there something in the SQS panel that gives us info on the messages?
2013-07-23 09:22:51	justinabrahms	no.
2013-07-23 09:22:54	justinabrahms	you get a number.
2013-07-23 09:23:18	nicholasserra	:(
2013-07-23 09:23:34	nicholasserra	Well, i'll get that trace stuff in. Then go from there.
2013-07-23 09:23:46	justinabrahms	http://i.imgur.com/tPzZdWK.png
2013-07-23 09:24:04	nicholasserra	If you have details on what you're thinking for the search stuff, make notes in that item. I'll get started on that too.
2013-07-23 09:24:32	justinabrahms	Sounds good.
2013-07-23 09:25:47	nicholasserra	How many celery boxes are we running? Is it time to maybe add another one?
2013-07-23 09:26:49	justinabrahms	3
2013-07-23 09:27:20	justinabrahms	It might be. Prove to me that we need one. :)
2013-07-23 09:27:25	nicholasserra	:P
2013-07-23 09:27:55	nicholasserra	Ya know, the most saturated task is probably that send_to_pusher call. Every time anything is changed that is dispatched. Might need to reevaluate that.
2013-07-23 09:28:16	justinabrahms	send to pusher happens in a different queue.
2013-07-23 09:28:38	justinabrahms	which *should* be monitored, but we should validate that stuff too

2013-07-24 10:38:52	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: There is a method in itemManager called removeItemFromCache that might help you out...
2013-07-24 10:39:19	nicholasserra	Thank the lord
2013-07-24 10:39:39	JSON_voorheez	Tim's cache consolidation should take care of bugs like this but until then..
2013-07-24 10:39:50	nicholasserra	So why doesn't:
2013-07-24 10:39:50	nicholasserra	ItemMasterCollection.getInstance().removeItemNumbers([this.item_.get('number')]);
2013-07-24 10:39:53	nicholasserra	also remove from cache?
2013-07-24 10:40:13	nicholasserra	Oh, that's not the item Manager I guess
2013-07-24 10:40:37	JSON_voorheez	removeItemNumbers is for removing just from the array of itemnumbers out of localstorage
2013-07-24 10:41:32	JSON_voorheez	ahh well it looks like it should still remove those items...
2013-07-24 10:42:44	nicholasserra	Yeah, that's what I'm running into. 
2013-07-24 10:42:49	nicholasserra	It should, but doesn't seem to be.
2013-07-24 10:42:55	nicholasserra	Let me see if manually calling it helps.
2013-07-24 10:43:59	nicholasserra	Nope, no good. What the fuck. It basically silently fails.
2013-07-24 10:44:12	nicholasserra	Well, actually, it won't even remove the item for me.
2013-07-24 10:44:16	nicholasserra	From the column view.
2013-07-24 10:44:36	JSON_voorheez	your in items column view>
2013-07-24 10:44:37	JSON_voorheez	?
2013-07-24 10:45:46	JSON_voorheez	I'm guessing you cant just call item.destoy() since your moving it to another product, you only need to remove it from the items collection and cache?
2013-07-24 10:46:07	nicholasserra	Here's my method for optimistically removing the item from the columns when you move it
2013-07-24 10:46:08	nicholasserra	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/blob/nick/move-item-to-product-new/html/static/js-sp/sprintly/views/sub/item_card_view.js#L848-L878
2013-07-24 10:46:28	nicholasserra	870 and 871 specifically to remove from columns
2013-07-24 10:46:50	nicholasserra	BUT if you're on the permalink page when you move it, it just needs to make it read_only.
2013-07-24 10:47:02	nicholasserra	So I think destroy will kick it out of that page right?
2013-07-24 10:48:03	JSON_voorheez	yeah if you destroy it will send you back to items view
2013-07-24 10:49:08	nicholasserra	Ugh so i'm kinda stuck. If it's in local storage it seems like it won't remove from columns view successfully.
2013-07-24 10:49:19	nicholasserra	Is there any way I can tell if its on the permalink page from within the item card view?
2013-07-24 10:50:03	JSON_voorheez	you could check a class in the dom 
2013-07-24 10:51:02	nicholasserra	Do we do that anywhere else?
2013-07-24 10:51:06	nicholasserra	Seems kinda sketchy.
2013-07-24 10:51:27	JSON_voorheez	yeah its definitly sketchy, i'm trying to think of another way
2013-07-24 10:51:47	JSON_voorheez	The only time we really check that is for columnNames and stageView
2013-07-24 10:52:12	nicholasserra	Hmmm
2013-07-24 10:52:50	nicholasserra	I guess this comes down to: Why can't I remove an Item from the columns if it's in local storage? 
2013-07-24 10:52:57	nicholasserra	Let me try to remove it from storage and then kill it.
2013-07-24 10:53:00	nicholasserra	Maybe I have an ordering problem.
2013-07-24 10:53:33	JSON_voorheez	you may move from localstorage on success
2013-07-24 10:54:39	nicholasserra	It seems like the item_card won't disappear if I nav to the permalink page first
2013-07-24 10:54:49	nicholasserra	When I call:
2013-07-24 10:54:49	nicholasserra	      ItemMasterCollection.getInstance().removeItemNumbers([this.item_.get('number')]);
2013-07-24 10:54:50	nicholasserra	      this.items_.remove([this.item_]);
2013-07-24 10:55:42	nicholasserra	If you wanna hop in my branch "nick/move-items" or something and take a look i'll be forever in debt.
2013-07-24 10:55:45	JSON_voorheez	its not disappearing at all?
2013-07-24 10:55:58	JSON_voorheez	yeah I'll take a look in a few
2013-07-24 10:56:00	nicholasserra	Nope, it gets converted to read only fine, but won't get removed.
2013-07-24 10:56:23	nicholasserra	Basically If Im on the Dash, and I create an item to backlog, then immediately Move to new product via the gear settings it goes away.
2013-07-24 10:56:34	nicholasserra	But If I create it, nav to it, then nav back to dash and move it, it stays.
2013-07-24 11:01:41	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: and I can't do destroy because that actually deletes the item
2013-07-24 11:01:55	nicholasserra	Although maybe I need to see what .destroy() does and use that, because it killed it.
2013-07-24 11:02:34	nicholasserra	Even with local storage
2013-07-24 11:04:28	nicholasserra	Whatever destroy is doing does the trick. But I don't want it to delete it serverside.
2013-07-24 11:04:42	nicholasserra	And I don't see where destroy is set.
2013-07-24 11:10:19	JSON_voorheez	its a backbone thang
2013-07-24 11:11:48	nicholasserra	Yah I'm just wondering how backbone is tied in to kill it from the master collection and the local storage
2013-07-24 11:11:59	nicholasserra	I have a headache.
2013-07-24 11:12:54	JSON_voorheez	just checkout out your branch, is there anything special i need to run?
2013-07-24 11:14:04	nicholasserra	Migrations, you'll be missing a couple fields on wasatch_item
2013-07-24 11:14:13	nicholasserra	read_only, moved_to, and deleted
2013-07-24 11:15:10	nicholasserra	./manage.py migrate should take care of it
2013-07-24 11:16:03	nicholasserra	<3
2013-07-24 11:20:06	justinabrahms	nicholasserra: fwiw, all of the caching stuff on the frontend is known to be in a stupid state.
2013-07-24 11:20:13	justinabrahms	as in the code is awful, not that it doesn't currently work.
2013-07-24 11:20:27	justinabrahms	there's an IMC pull request out which makes that story a little nicer
2013-07-24 11:20:59	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: running migrations...
2013-07-24 11:21:05	nicholasserra	Yeah, i've been watching that.
2013-07-24 11:22:38	justinabrahms	have you been watching those recurly merges?
2013-07-24 11:23:14	justinabrahms	https://github.com/sprintly/sprint.ly/compare/master...billing-interstitial  currently at +2800, -2100
2013-07-24 11:23:59	nicholasserra	Yup. There's been a ton of merges going around. Is that the new 'main' branch for it?
2013-07-24 11:24:21	justinabrahms	billing-interstitial is the staging branch before it all goes to master.
2013-07-24 11:25:29	nicholasserra	You should make a WIP PR for that, so we can hit it at a glance and see when it needs rebased.
2013-07-24 11:26:38	justinabrahms	Not sure I follow?
2013-07-24 11:27:31	nicholasserra	Just a Pull Request for that main branch. Instead of hitting the compare URL when we want to see it. Since we'll need a pull request eventually anyway. And it will show merge status.
2013-07-24 11:35:06	justinabrahms	The only reason to look at that is for the diff stats, I think. :)  Each thing that has gone into the branch has been indepdenantly reviewed. Going to hold off on the PR just so I can skip out on keeping it up to date.

2013-07-24 11:56:29	justinabrahms	moving account model to the accounts app. now all django-ajax endpoints are broken because of its magic.
2013-07-24 11:58:57	nicholasserra	I thought all the ajax calls were prefaced with the app? /ajax/wasatch/item/
2013-07-24 11:59:17	justinabrahms	yea.
2013-07-24 11:59:21	justinabrahms	so now the app is "accounts"
2013-07-24 11:59:33	justinabrahms	so I have to change all the code in the frontend and backend tests :-/
2013-07-24 11:59:33	JSON_voorheez	nicholasserra: everything seems to be working right in this branch for me...
2013-07-24 11:59:45	nicholasserra	justinabrahms: yeah :(
2013-07-24 12:00:02	JSON_voorheez	except the redirect from permalink, we should redirect to items page
2013-07-24 12:00:38	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: The way I broke it is to… go to dashboard and create item to backlog, click on new item to go to permalink page, then nav back to dashboard and then move the item via the settings gear menu
2013-07-24 12:00:54	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: When i do that, the item goes to read_only, but the item card won't get removed.
2013-07-24 12:01:03	nicholasserra	I'm using FF
2013-07-24 12:02:34	JSON_voorheez	that is super weird
2013-07-24 12:02:35	JSON_voorheez	ugh
2013-07-24 12:02:59	nicholasserra	And Joe is having some other issue that I can't replicate. But this is the main one i'm seeing.
2013-07-24 12:03:14	JSON_voorheez	so it isn't there after a refresh...
2013-07-24 12:03:23	nicholasserra	Basically, nav around to make sure the new item is in local storage before you move it.
2013-07-24 12:03:30	nicholasserra	Yeah, that works for me.
2013-07-24 12:03:33	JSON_voorheez	so it's either still in sprintly.cache or itemscollections
2013-07-24 12:04:06	nicholasserra	It's just odd to me that some of the item cards disappear right away for me, and ones that I go to the permalink page on don't disappear.
2013-07-24 12:04:16	JSON_voorheez	it is odd indeed
2013-07-24 12:04:18	nicholasserra	They stay in the columns after I click move.
2013-07-24 12:04:28	nicholasserra	So you don't see that issue at all?
2013-07-24 12:05:03	JSON_voorheez	oh no I am
2013-07-24 12:05:19	JSON_voorheez	read only items are still in these columns
2013-07-24 12:05:42	nicholasserra	Okay, but it's fine after refresh?
2013-07-24 12:05:52	nicholasserra	Basically sometimes they won't get killed right away from the columns.
2013-07-24 12:06:08	nicholasserra	And i'm thinking it's because they are in local storage.
2013-07-24 12:06:27	JSON_voorheez	yeah a refresh doesnt fix it all
2013-07-24 12:06:59	nicholasserra	Refresh is working for me. Are you seeing the issue where they don't get removed from the columns right away?

2013-07-24 12:57:30	nicholasserra	Yup, that fixes my ghost item_card problem.
2013-07-24 13:00:22	JSON_voorheez	that remove item numbers is supposed to find dupes and remove them
2013-07-24 13:06:01	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: It does. My problem is that local storage itself is returning duplicate item numbers in that helpers function. 
2013-07-24 13:06:38	nicholasserra	JSON_voorheez: If you wanna try it yourself, console log 'value' in ItemMasterCollection.prototype.getItemNumbers_

2013-07-24 13:07:35	JSON_voorheez	ahh i see
2013-07-24 13:07:55	nicholasserra	Which, I think is causing my problem with the item card not getting nuked.
2013-07-24 13:08:03	JSON_voorheez	so we should probably add _uniq or something on save to localstorage
2013-07-24 13:08:21	nicholasserra	Well I don't know if the problem is the data being put in or the data coming out.
2013-07-24 13:08:29	nicholasserra	Probably when it goes in.
2013-07-24 13:08:45	JSON_voorheez	hmm, you can always open up and look
2013-07-24 13:08:45	nicholasserra	Or if Tim has already fixed that.
2013-07-24 13:09:06	JSON_voorheez	would be a good thing to comment in that repo,
2013-07-24 13:09:10	nicholasserra	But I don't wanna get into fixing any of that stuff in my branch obviously. So I'm like on hold.
2013-07-24 13:09:21	JSON_voorheez	yeah i hear that
2013-07-24 13:10:18	nicholasserra	I'm guessing his rewrite has addressed that.
2013-07-24 13:10:26	nicholasserra	I'll fire off an email to him and ask.
2013-07-24 13:10:29	JSON_voorheez	sweet
2013-07-24 13:10:57	nicholasserra	Or i'll just comment on that pull request.

2013-07-24 13:34:31	nicholasserra	I'm guessing Joe is on a bad internet connection hah
2013-07-24 13:35:25	jstump	Haha, yeah.
2013-07-24 13:35:39	jstump	Actually great service interrupted by train tunnels.
2013-07-24 13:35:55	Yadah_	speaking of bad internet getting mine looked over tomorrow
2013-07-24 13:36:11	nicholasserra	You need fiber. We all need fiber.
2013-07-24 13:36:32	Yadah_	Sadly Hutto is not on the list... because no one has heard of Hutto but Austin is
2013-07-24 13:38:55	nicholasserra	I'm in a triangle of large cities. They better get to me soon hah

2013-07-24 13:46:31	Yadah_	Yeah its not like my job needs it...
2013-07-24 13:47:13	Yadah_	quick question that may involve some Joe theory  would you suggest sprint.ly to a hardcore Kanban type?
2013-07-24 13:48:14	jstump1	I wouldn't recommend Sprint.ly to any "hardcore [dogmatic process paradigm]" people.
2013-07-24 13:48:32	Yadah_	ok
2013-07-24 13:49:36	jstump1	It's like telling an Orthodox [religion] to go to the [left leaning part of the religion]'s church.
2013-07-24 13:50:14	jstump1	That being said, I'm always looking for feedback and thoughts on how we could improve. 
2013-07-24 13:50:20	jstump1	So we should *engage* for sure.
2013-07-24 13:50:58	Yadah_	indeed 
2013-07-24 13:52:02	nicholasserra	jstump1: What do you usually do for a merge of master into a branch? I always do rebases. Just git merge branchname master?
