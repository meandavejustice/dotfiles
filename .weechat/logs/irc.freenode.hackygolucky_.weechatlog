2013-07-26 14:47:03	JSON_voorheez	sweet! and if you could get that gist link he did that would be dope...
2013-07-26 14:47:20	JSON_voorheez	I'm gunna try to rework this color sensor to work with 6 different leds
2013-07-26 14:47:32	JSON_voorheez	I'll probably just fork it, modify and put it on npm
2013-07-26 14:52:19	JSON_voorheez	this sux
2013-07-26 14:58:07	hackygolucky_	it sucks because we don't have the stuff ready? or that it's hard?
2013-07-26 14:58:22	hackygolucky_	I should have asked adam to redo the frietzig diagram
2013-07-26 14:58:27	hackygolucky_	he's the one who worked on it with nexxy
2013-07-26 14:58:29	hackygolucky_	:-/
2013-07-26 14:58:38	JSON_voorheez	that we don't have anything ready
2013-07-26 14:58:48	JSON_voorheez	im fine with hard :)
2013-07-26 14:59:03	JSON_voorheez	I just thought we had a beginners track _ready_
2013-07-26 14:59:03	hackygolucky_	Sorry. Everyone's been busy...
2013-07-26 14:59:09	hackygolucky_	yeah, we did too
2013-07-26 14:59:15	JSON_voorheez	I know, but it is tomorrow
2013-07-26 14:59:22	hackygolucky_	until that rgb led order discovery happened
2013-07-26 14:59:34	hackygolucky_	yurp
2013-07-26 14:59:36	hackygolucky_	so.
2013-07-26 14:59:43	hackygolucky_	we COULD publish as is.
2013-07-26 14:59:52	JSON_voorheez	i know, i'm hacking a new one together right now
2013-07-26 14:59:56	JSON_voorheez	in dis coffeeshop
2013-07-26 15:00:00	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-07-26 15:00:09	hackygolucky_	well, if it gets too stressful, seriously don't worry about it.
2013-07-26 15:00:12	hackygolucky_	just publish as-is.
2013-07-26 15:00:19	JSON_voorheez	nah I can do it :)
2013-07-26 15:00:31	hackygolucky_	alright...
2013-07-26 15:00:42	JSON_voorheez	my roommate is in here with me and shit is super embarresed
2013-07-26 15:00:43	JSON_voorheez	haha
2013-07-26 15:00:45	hackygolucky_	Chris is almost out of a thing, and then I'll bug him about the drawings
2013-07-26 15:00:46	hackygolucky_	cool?
2013-07-26 15:00:53	JSON_voorheez	perf!
2013-07-26 15:01:24	JSON_voorheez	I'm not angry with anyone just to make that clear 
2013-07-26 15:03:05	hackygolucky_	I know, but there's a bunch of cooks in the kitchen. Or pigs in the pen. It's hard to wrangle a bunch of wily greasy pigs
2013-07-26 15:03:08	hackygolucky_	:P
2013-07-26 15:04:10	JSON_voorheez	haha indeed

2013-08-01 20:13:47	hackygolucky_	 you're gonna make me bust out laughing in the middle of this.
2013-09-25 13:19:39	hackygolucky_	So I'm trying to figure out whether this will be worth my time
2013-09-25 13:19:56	hackygolucky_	is modifying wordpress sites a pain in the ass?
2013-09-25 13:20:12	JSON_voorhees	depends on how it was built
2013-09-25 13:20:18	hackygolucky_	the dude wants some plugins. I don't think I have to do a whole rewrite.
2013-09-25 13:20:20	JSON_voorhees	but you shouldn't have much trouble
2013-09-25 13:20:38	JSON_voorhees	what kind of stuff is he trying to add?
2013-09-25 13:20:40	hackygolucky_	mind me asking how much you charged when you were doing wordprss work?
2013-09-25 13:20:52	JSON_voorhees	hmm
2013-09-25 13:20:53	hackygolucky_	all he's said so far is something regarding Instagram
2013-09-25 13:21:04	JSON_voorhees	lemme think
2013-09-25 13:21:05	hackygolucky_	assuming he just wants third party api stuff.
2013-09-25 13:21:37	hackygolucky_	I'm also trying to assess whether I even care to do this. I'm looking for experience more than I'm looking for dollars.
2013-09-25 13:21:49	JSON_voorhees	I probably wouldn't charge much to just add in somethings, I would probably do an hourly thing for that
2013-09-25 13:22:43	JSON_voorhees	what are you looking for experience wise?
2013-09-25 13:23:03	JSON_voorhees	to work with instagram api? or to work with a client?
2013-09-25 13:24:02	hackygolucky_	to get general experience with contract work but really any web dev that isn't EXACTLY what I'm doing at UA. 
2013-09-25 13:25:07	JSON_voorhees	i see
2013-09-25 13:25:08	JSON_voorhees	cool
2013-09-25 13:25:40	JSON_voorhees	probably wouldn't be bad to learn your way around wordpress sites
2013-09-25 13:25:54	JSON_voorhees	it is a wordpress site and not a wordpress blog right?
2013-09-25 13:26:06	JSON_voorhees	cus you have pretty much no control over the blogs
2013-09-25 13:27:54	hackygolucky_	I think it's a site http://thebencarter.com/
2013-09-25 13:28:23	hackygolucky_	I have never stepped foot near Wordpress, though I had been told it was a great way to get started moons ago.
2013-09-25 13:30:56	JSON_voorhees	yeah u should do it
2013-09-25 13:31:10	hackygolucky_	Most excellent.
2013-09-25 13:31:12	hackygolucky_	thanks!

2013-10-07 18:43:16	hackygolucky_	heh, what's up?
2013-10-07 20:09:05	JSON_voorhees	what kind of issues are you having with require?
2013-10-07 20:11:53	hackygolucky_	fucking error swallowing
2013-10-07 20:12:05	hackygolucky_	so chris recommended I do a try/catch
2013-10-07 20:12:26	hackygolucky_	but am I looking in the browser for the error then? on the command line?
2013-10-07 20:12:39	hackygolucky_	I can't wrap the whole file in that
2013-10-07 20:12:48	hackygolucky_	so do I wrap everything inside of it?
2013-10-07 20:13:27	JSON_voorhees	do you know anything about the error? are these from some kind of logging like sentry?
2013-10-07 20:13:56	hackygolucky_	it's from our test runner, Drive.js
2013-10-07 20:14:00	hackygolucky_	modeled after mocha
2013-10-07 20:14:02	JSON_voorhees	I assume the in browser stack trace is too long to hit any actual ua code?
2013-10-07 20:14:13	JSON_voorhees	ahh
2013-10-07 20:14:38	JSON_voorhees	so you are trying to catch an error with the test runner, or the actual test?
2013-10-07 20:14:47	hackygolucky_	I've got the error
2013-10-07 20:14:52	hackygolucky_	I can't make heads or tails of it
2013-10-07 20:14:58	JSON_voorhees	ahh
2013-10-07 20:15:11	hackygolucky_	I'll link the gist
2013-10-07 20:15:15	JSON_voorhees	yeah
2013-10-07 20:15:55	hackygolucky_	the test runner result https://gist.github.com/hackygolucky/ed3bfd03b8f217c803c2
2013-10-07 20:16:15	hackygolucky_	the files are all where they are supposed to be
2013-10-07 20:16:21	hackygolucky_	but requirejs is putzing out
2013-10-07 20:16:48	hackygolucky_	also, the Error result is showing a weird url that doesn't exist. it almost looks like it is concatenating urls somehow.
2013-10-07 20:17:14	JSON_voorhees	god that is weird
2013-10-07 20:17:16	hackygolucky_	so chris then recommended I wrap the guts of the module in question in a try/catch
2013-10-07 20:17:24	hackygolucky_	but I can't get anything to produce from that.
2013-10-07 20:18:47	JSON_voorhees	can you link just the imports in authentication.js?
2013-10-07 20:19:02	JSON_voorhees	that error is usually just a syntax thing
2013-10-07 20:19:33	JSON_voorhees	oh just saw your comment
2013-10-07 20:19:41	JSON_voorhees	you obv. looked at that
2013-10-07 20:22:05	hackygolucky_	yeah
2013-10-07 20:22:37	JSON_voorhees	what happens when you wrap that module?
2013-10-07 20:22:55	hackygolucky_	it just gets angry because it doesn't know how to handle define/require
2013-10-07 20:23:59	JSON_voorhees	throw a debugger in before that import
2013-10-07 20:24:19	JSON_voorhees	then see if you can find out a little more in the console
2013-10-07 20:24:47	JSON_voorhees	you will have to change the imports to lead with var instead of those silly commas for a second though.
2013-10-07 20:25:54	hackygolucky_	hah

2013-10-08 10:39:02	hackygolucky_	and the classic circular dependency issue came up
2013-10-08 10:39:37	hackygolucky_	so Good!(that the surface of the problem was discovered) but FUCK ME because now I have to figure out what is circling
2013-10-08 10:53:22	JSON_voorhees	haha that sucks man
