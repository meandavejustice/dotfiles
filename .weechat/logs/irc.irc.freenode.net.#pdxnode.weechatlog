2013-05-22 10:39:36	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: I think a lot of his advice is really good, but some just strikes me as borderline superstitious. If you listen to him talk about it, he turns out to be pretty chill on many specifics.
2013-05-22 10:46:04	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: I mean, overall, the Good Parts is a really great talk and book. I guess it is just a lesson in 'don't blindly believe the teacher' for me.
2013-05-22 10:48:20	dlmanning	On a slightly different topic, I'm super excited about ES6's 'fat-arrow' functions
2013-05-22 10:52:01	hackygolucky_	Whoa.
2013-05-22 10:52:01	hackygolucky_	Didn't know that was being considered(it's hard to stay up on all these things, yeesh)
2013-05-22 10:52:01	hackygolucky_	I wonder if we'll be allowed to use that.
2013-05-22 10:52:01	hackygolucky_	(we have a style guide)
2013-05-22 10:52:01	dlmanning	You mean UA?
2013-05-22 10:52:01	hackygolucky_	yup.
2013-05-22 10:52:42	dlmanning	'fat-arrow' may not be the best looking syntax, but lexical 'this' is a big bucket of win
2013-05-22 11:36:29	dlmanning	Would people be interested in a talk on ES6 features coming to Node?

2013-05-22 12:35:09	chrisdickinson	oh god fat arrows
2013-05-22 12:35:31	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: i'd be okay with fat arrows if they didn't add yet another different type of function
2013-05-22 12:35:41	chrisdickinson	i.e., bind doesn't work on them and `new` throws an exception on their use

2013-05-22 12:38:28	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: I would be VERY interested in it.
2013-05-22 12:38:58	hackygolucky_	seeing as I help organize who is speaking, is that enough say? I can be a tad self-serving sometimes.
2013-05-22 12:39:11	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-05-22 12:39:24	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: I was wondering how they got it to work and what barriers there would be.
2013-05-22 12:39:31	hackygolucky_	There always seems to be a catch.
2013-05-22 12:39:42	chrisdickinson	import statements, template literals, `let` scoping, fat arrow functions, oh, let's see, what else...
2013-05-22 12:39:49	chrisdickinson	maximally minimal classes
2013-05-22 12:39:51	hackygolucky_	So that's a big fat 'NO' then, eh? :D
2013-05-22 12:39:54	chrisdickinson	setPrototypeOf
2013-05-22 12:40:06	chrisdickinson	though for a while there was __proto__
2013-05-22 12:40:09	chrisdickinson	not sure if that's still in

2013-05-22 12:41:06	hackygolucky_	nice!
2013-05-22 12:41:07	chrisdickinson	weakmaps, maps, sets
2013-05-22 12:41:16	chrisdickinson	oh yeah symbols
2013-05-22 12:41:33	chrisdickinson	generators
2013-05-22 12:41:45	chrisdickinson	really it'd be simpler to list the things they *aren't* adding
2013-05-22 12:41:58	hackygolucky_	so what do you have to do to get participate with TC39?
2013-05-22 12:42:06	hackygolucky_	hand over a tiny bit of soul?
2013-05-22 12:42:10	chrisdickinson	for each of

2013-05-22 12:42:35	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I get what you're saying re: fat arrows
2013-05-22 12:42:55	hackygolucky_	pay?
2013-05-22 12:43:05	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-05-22 12:43:14	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: But I rather think the two objections you raised are features
2013-05-22 12:43:23	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: things that break duck typing aren't features
2013-05-22 12:43:33	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-05-22 12:43:56	dlmanning	As with most of javascript, restraint is required
2013-05-22 12:44:14	dlmanning	But self = this and .bind(this) are nasty hacks
2013-05-22 12:44:18	hackygolucky_	pay?
2013-05-22 12:44:22	chrisdickinson	â€¦ yep
2013-05-22 12:44:28	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: eeeh, not really
2013-05-22 12:44:34	chrisdickinson	i mean, self = this is fine
2013-05-22 12:44:40	chrisdickinson	bind is a lil' worthless
2013-05-22 12:44:47	chrisdickinson	would rather see that as a tight binding lookup or something
2013-05-22 12:45:06	dlmanning	That would be awesome if you could implement it without breaking things
2013-05-22 12:45:08	chrisdickinson	https://github.com/chrisdickinson/jabbascript#the-unary-tight-binding-operator
2013-05-22 12:45:24	chrisdickinson	if i had picked a different symbol than `:` (i.e. `@`) it would work
2013-05-22 12:46:07	chrisdickinson	as always, my primary issue with es6 is that they're adding things scattershot with no real restraint in how the new things play with each other, or with old things really
2013-05-22 12:46:24	chrisdickinson	there's a lot of cool, useful stuff in there
2013-05-22 12:46:50	chrisdickinson	`let` is actually particularly neat because it obviates the need to do the `arr.forEach` dance inside of loops with closures inside
2013-05-22 12:46:59	dlmanning	Yeah, I'm a fan of let
2013-05-22 12:47:10	dlmanning	I'm making t-shirts that say "let is the new var"
2013-05-22 12:47:41	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-05-22 12:48:16	dlmanning	It's a dilemma between breaking backwards compatibility and fixing old mistakes
2013-05-22 12:48:43	dlmanning	The lack of lexical this was a mistake

2013-05-22 12:49:37	dlmanning	Some people are throughly accostumed to working around it and don't think we need to add fat-arrow functions
2013-05-22 12:49:47	dlmanning	I get that. That's totally legitimate
2013-05-22 12:50:49	chrisdickinson	function-scoped `this` makes sense
2013-05-22 12:51:00	dlmanning	Personally, I'm looking forward to playing with them. I think they make the code clearner to read and I can keep track of how not to do Bad Things with them
2013-05-22 12:51:02	chrisdickinson	it takes a while to get it to make sense
2013-05-22 12:51:16	chrisdickinson	but if you look into how, say, python deals with functions

2013-05-22 12:51:23	chrisdickinson	you realize that js's way is more sane
2013-05-22 12:51:35	chrisdickinson	or at least, easier to reason about
2013-05-22 12:53:06	dlmanning	I thought your biggest objection would have been their lack of names
2013-05-22 12:53:53	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: oh, with shorthand functions? nah
2013-05-22 12:54:15	chrisdickinson	i'd actually love them if not for the different semantics -- `bind` not working / `new` barfing
2013-05-22 12:54:39	chrisdickinson	naming would be nice, but i mostly use naming because it really aids debugging
2013-05-22 12:54:45	chrisdickinson	or for hoisting
2013-05-22 12:54:46	dlmanning	yeah
2013-05-22 12:55:26	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: I see your point about bind(), but it doesn't seem hard to avoid using them with new
2013-05-22 12:55:43	dlmanning	Seems like you'd have to go out of your way to have that be a problem
2013-05-22 12:55:51	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: theoretically yes; but i object because it's another thing i've got to keep in my head
2013-05-22 12:56:00	chrisdickinson	also
2013-05-22 12:56:04	chrisdickinson	for real fun
2013-05-22 12:56:09	chrisdickinson	check out `break label` / `continue label`
2013-05-22 12:56:28	chrisdickinson	best ever language feature of any language or feature of all time, ever
2013-05-22 12:57:05	dlmanning	Yeah, that's just a goto statement :)
2013-05-22 13:01:15	chrisdickinson	well, not entirely
2013-05-22 13:01:21	chrisdickinson	since it can only `goto` the start of a loop
2013-05-22 13:02:17	dlmanning	true
2013-05-22 13:04:21	dlmanning	I think that if you use `break label` or `continue label` JSLint just stops parsing and asks you to go outside think about your life
2013-05-22 13:04:47	chrisdickinson	haha

2013-05-22 20:33:10	hackygolucky	He makes dumb provocative statements that apparently are effective

2013-05-24 13:05:55	Wraithan	So, I built this:
2013-05-24 13:05:58	Wraithan	https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot/blob/3.0-devel/bot.js
2013-05-24 13:06:21	Wraithan	And, really, having as an object like that gives me nothing since I am not exporting anything and only ever using it as a bin
2013-05-24 13:06:40	Wraithan	I'm curious what ways you folks would rewrite that
2013-05-24 13:08:44	Wraithan	most of that is setting up listeners to relay data into redis
2013-05-24 13:10:13	hackygolucky_	Wraithan: I think you might be missing a 'var' in front of zenircbot
2013-05-24 13:10:27	hackygolucky_	unless I'm overlooking that.
2013-05-24 13:10:39	hackygolucky_	but that is very very basic.
2013-05-24 13:10:48	Wraithan	I fixed that I thought
2013-05-24 13:10:50	Wraithan	maybe I need to push
2013-05-24 13:11:56	Wraithan	crap, wrong link
2013-05-24 13:12:03	Wraithan	https://github.com/zenirc/zenircbot/blob/3.0-devel/bot.js
2013-05-24 13:13:18	hackygolucky_	ah, better
2013-05-24 13:13:26	Wraithan	I cleaned up all the accidental globals in this version
2013-05-24 13:13:31	hackygolucky_	indeed.
2013-05-24 13:14:12	Wraithan	semicolon stuff is not standardized in the file, need to do that eventually
2013-05-24 13:14:50	Wraithan	Hmmm, there is a potential bug in the ping stuff, once I re-enable multiple servers
2013-05-24 13:16:15	Wraithan	Anyway, more just thinking about rebuilding it without the giant object, or building it more in a style using prototypes, etc
2013-05-24 13:18:48	Wraithan	It just feels bad how it is
2013-05-24 13:18:59	 *	chrisdickinson peers
2013-05-24 13:19:58	Wraithan	Using prototypes and `this` feels more right
2013-05-24 13:20:09	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-05-24 13:20:20	Wraithan	But I don't know if maybe I should do other stuff
2013-05-24 13:20:22	Wraithan	lol
2013-05-24 13:20:37	chrisdickinson	i would expose it as a function that returns an instance of your constructor when called
2013-05-24 13:20:51	Wraithan	I don't really need to write it for the 3.0 stuff, it just bothers me whenever I go into this file
2013-05-24 13:20:52	chrisdickinson	unless it makes sense for things to "be a" bot
2013-05-24 13:20:58	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: so a singleton?
2013-05-24 13:21:02	chrisdickinson	no no
2013-05-24 13:21:08	chrisdickinson	oooh
2013-05-24 13:21:13	chrisdickinson	so it's a singleton now
2013-05-24 13:21:22	chrisdickinson	-ish-thing
2013-05-24 13:21:31	Wraithan	yeah, -ish-thing is the problem
2013-05-24 13:21:36	Wraithan	I thought you meant returnt he same instance
2013-05-24 13:22:02	chrisdickinson	this is the problem with me just jumping into code before giving myself time to see how the entire package hangs together
2013-05-24 13:22:05	Wraithan	Yeah, the move to multiple servers can be handled by multiple instances of the bot, it can be handled by the bot keeping track of multiple connecitons
2013-05-24 13:22:18	Wraithan	So I don't really care too much
2013-05-24 13:22:22	Wraithan	more just want to make this nicer
2013-05-24 13:22:28	Wraithan	so I dont' hate myself every time I go into this file
2013-05-24 13:23:09	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: i'd pull it out into several files for one -- paying attention to what state is actually *required* to be shared
2013-05-24 13:23:21	Wraithan	Why several files?
2013-05-24 13:23:21	chrisdickinson	because as-is, there's a lot of state to keep in mind as you scan through this file
2013-05-24 13:23:57	chrisdickinson	thl0 put it best: putting things in "small modules" (i.e., multiple files with single-export functions) keeps you from accumulating too much state
2013-05-24 13:24:21	Wraithan	You remove the addListener stuff and it is actually a pretty small thing
2013-05-24 13:24:33	chrisdickinson	right, but what state does that stuff use from that file?
2013-05-24 13:24:37	chrisdickinson	just the zen bot
2013-05-24 13:26:03	Wraithan	Ok, I could potentially see moving that out
2013-05-24 13:26:09	Wraithan	but that feels like files for hte sake of files
2013-05-24 13:26:11	chrisdickinson	i guess my position is that by splitting out the bits into a few files that just "take" the bot instance you can treat this module like what it is -- glue that binds together several different behaviors
2013-05-24 13:26:13	Wraithan	not any benefit
2013-05-24 13:26:40	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: that's the criticism leveled at the approach, yes
2013-05-24 13:27:09	chrisdickinson	but multiple smaller files are much easier to reason about
2013-05-24 13:28:14	Wraithan	I guess at the VERY MOST I can see 3 files, the bin, the listeners, and the version handling stuff
2013-05-24 13:28:32	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-05-24 13:28:34	Wraithan	which I can't see giving me anything
2013-05-24 13:28:36	chrisdickinson	that's about right i'd say
2013-05-24 13:28:42	chrisdickinson	it doesn't give *you* anything
2013-05-24 13:28:48	chrisdickinson	but as a reader i can more easily reason about your code
2013-05-24 13:29:02	chrisdickinson	this isn't big enough (yet) that it'll give you problems reasoning about it
2013-05-24 13:29:21	Wraithan	Other than additional listeners this file has been shrinking, not growing
2013-05-24 13:29:34	Wraithan	I guess that isn't completely true, the heartbeat added lines
2013-05-24 13:29:35	chrisdickinson	fair enough
2013-05-24 13:30:24	Wraithan	ok
2013-05-24 13:30:26	Wraithan	I'll try moving it out
2013-05-24 13:30:31	chrisdickinson	it might be a little weird
2013-05-24 13:30:34	chrisdickinson	but yeah, try it
2013-05-24 13:30:43	Wraithan	doesn't actually change anything like what I was asking about
2013-05-24 13:30:50	chrisdickinson	hah
2013-05-24 13:30:55	chrisdickinson	right
2013-05-24 13:31:24	chrisdickinson	well, you asked "I'm curious what ways you folks would rewrite that" :)
2013-05-24 13:31:31	Wraithan	yea
2013-05-24 13:31:39	Wraithan	more was refering to the object
2013-05-24 13:31:43	chrisdickinson	well
2013-05-24 13:31:45	hackygolucky_	ask and ye shall receive
2013-05-24 13:31:58	chrisdickinson	so this is way more aesthetics from me
2013-05-24 13:32:01	chrisdickinson	but
2013-05-24 13:32:07	Wraithan	asi, 2space, etc?
2013-05-24 13:32:12	chrisdickinson	i hate it when i have var obj = {asdf: function() { } }
2013-05-24 13:32:18	chrisdickinson	no no
2013-05-24 13:32:27	Wraithan	yeah, that is more what I was asking about
2013-05-24 13:32:32	chrisdickinson	i recoil at function expressions nested in objects
2013-05-24 13:32:38	chrisdickinson	i would pull 'em out into named functions
2013-05-24 13:32:43	chrisdickinson	and the object literal just assigns at the top
2013-05-24 13:32:44	Wraithan	maybe moving it to prototype based, or a series of top level functions
2013-05-24 13:33:15	chrisdickinson	like var zenircbot = {setup: setup, server_config_for: server_config_for} â€¦ etc etc
2013-05-24 13:33:18	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-05-24 13:33:26	chrisdickinson	i think either of those would make me feel better
2013-05-24 13:33:30	chrisdickinson	aesthetically better
2013-05-24 13:33:31	Wraithan	I got rid of that style
2013-05-24 13:33:33	chrisdickinson	i mean
2013-05-24 13:33:36	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-05-24 13:33:38	Wraithan	because it is needlessly verbose
2013-05-24 13:33:44	chrisdickinson	which style?
2013-05-24 13:33:50	Wraithan	the one you just mentioned
2013-05-24 13:34:14	chrisdickinson	on the other hand, you're guaranteed to get better stack traces with named functions
2013-05-24 13:35:28	chrisdickinson	if you were to go the prototype style i would encourage just doing `var proto = Bot.prototype` and assigning functions like `proto.setup = function() {`
2013-05-24 13:36:59	Wraithan	I guess it wasn't that style in bot.js ever it was in the api
2013-05-24 13:39:00	Wraithan	It is the var blah = {funcName: funcName} or the style I am currently using both feel bad
2013-05-24 13:49:07	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: would you subdir those files into something like lib/
2013-05-24 13:49:09	Wraithan	?
2013-05-24 13:49:21	Wraithan	I am leery about adding more top level files
2013-05-24 13:49:37	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: yeah, `lib/`
2013-05-24 13:49:48	chrisdickinson	folks rag on `lib/` a lot but it beats having big toplevel files
2013-05-24 13:49:53	Wraithan	totally
2013-05-24 13:50:18	Wraithan	I am in favor of breaking everything out of lib/ that could be its own module
2013-05-24 13:50:21	chrisdickinson	from there it's easy to break out into new packages when and if it makes sense
2013-05-24 13:50:21	Wraithan	but this case it doens't make a damn bit of sense to be its own thin
2013-05-24 13:50:25	chrisdickinson	right right
2013-05-24 13:50:37	chrisdickinson	i'm trying to train myself to say "packages" when i mean "things published on npm"
2013-05-24 13:50:45	chrisdickinson	and "modules" when i mean "file that exports a thing"
2013-05-24 13:52:24	Wraithan	ah, yea
2013-05-24 14:50:12	Wraithan	https://github.com/zenirc/zenircbot/blob/3.0-devel/bot.js
2013-05-24 14:50:27	Wraithan	well that is it with all those irc listeners moved out
2013-05-24 14:51:57	Wraithan	still needs cleanup

2013-06-04 00:13:22	dlmanning	I typed up the talk outline and sent in a PR

2013-06-04 13:28:13	dlmanning	Wraithan: So I'm saying the tattoo sunscreen is a way of marketing a higher SPF specifically to tattooed people
2013-06-04 13:28:29	dlmanning	But yeah, they could just buy regular SPF 50
2013-06-04 13:28:29	Wraithan	yes, and they probably charge more
2013-06-04 13:28:31	Wraithan	for no reason
2013-06-04 13:28:36	dlmanning	Yeah :)
2013-06-04 13:28:36	Wraithan	It is just sunscreen
2013-06-04 13:29:25	dlmanning	I'm sure @cabel enjoyed our dialog
2013-06-04 13:29:46	Wraithan	Also, I'm willing to bet it has fragrance in it, 99% of that shit does, so even if you were getting it specifically because your tattoo is still healing and you don't want to cover it, it would probably itch like shit
2013-06-04 13:30:28	dlmanning	If your shit is itching you should probably see your GP
2013-06-04 13:30:33	Wraithan	hah
2013-06-04 13:32:43	dlmanning	Woot! OSX 10.8.4. Let's see if Apple has figured out how to render iMessage timestamps in chronological order
2013-06-04 14:31:11	--	adamdicarlo_ is now known as adamdicarlo
2013-06-04 14:48:09	Wraithan	So, it looks like if I write a browserify plugin for firefoxos that covers `net` then I could have node-irc on firefoxos
2013-06-04 14:48:17	Wraithan	which means I could make a proper client
2013-06-04 14:48:34	chrisdickinson	nice!

2013-06-04 15:03:41	Wraithan	it?
2013-06-04 15:03:43	Wraithan	man
2013-06-04 15:04:14	Wraithan	So the firefoxos stuff I'm going to build for browserify should be all of the stuff needed to make js-git work on firefoxos

2013-06-04 15:17:08	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: yep! i do believe so.
2013-06-04 15:17:17	chrisdickinson	hence my "oo" in the other channel :)
2013-06-04 15:17:40	chrisdickinson	was hoping for something similar in chrome os, but creationix decided to NIH-stream it
2013-06-04 15:21:35	Wraithan	dlmanning: yeah, don't bother
2013-06-04 15:21:40	Wraithan	at least that is my opinion
2013-06-04 15:22:45	Wraithan	It is generally a bunch of wank-y corporate crap and you can get the good stuff at osbridge
2013-06-04 15:22:54	dlmanning	It overlaps with NodeConf anyway
2013-06-04 15:23:05	Wraithan	Even more reason to not support it :)
2013-06-04 15:23:07	Wraithan	:D
2013-06-04 15:23:13	 *	Wraithan works for a corp now
2013-06-04 15:23:26	Wraithan	that is sometimes wanky
2013-06-04 15:23:31	Wraithan	so I probably shouldn't talk so much shit
2013-06-04 15:24:03	dlmanning	Is osbridge worth attending?
2013-06-04 15:24:09	Wraithan	always
2013-06-04 15:24:22	dlmanning	You're not just saying that because mozilla is a sponsor? ;)
2013-06-04 15:24:28	Wraithan	we sponsor everything
2013-06-04 15:24:30	Wraithan	even tstuf
2013-06-04 15:24:37	Wraithan	stuff I don't like
2013-06-04 15:24:58	dlmanning	hmm $300 isn't too bad
2013-06-04 15:25:10	Wraithan	dlmanning: you can volunteer for 8 hours and get free admission
2013-06-04 15:25:22	dlmanning	oreally
2013-06-04 15:25:32	dlmanning	iiiinteresting...
2013-06-04 15:25:51	dlmanning	that is probably a thing that I will do then :)
2013-06-04 15:26:10	Wraithan	I think you can also do some combo
2013-06-04 15:26:53	Wraithan	dlmanning: #osbridge is a good place to ask questions
2013-06-04 15:27:05	dlmanning	word
2013-06-04 15:28:37	Wraithan	dlmanning: favorite part of osbridge is that it is the opposite of insular. It isn't everyone from the the same language/framework/etc, we are all just open source people, hardware/software/management/etc
2013-06-04 15:28:46	Wraithan	huge variety in the people and the talks
2013-06-04 15:29:04	dlmanning	*nod*
2013-06-04 15:29:28	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: did you go last year?
2013-06-04 15:29:41	dlmanning	you had me at "...and get free admission"
2013-06-04 15:29:42	chrisdickinson	osbridge? nope
2013-06-04 15:29:47	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: you should go this year
2013-06-04 15:29:51	chrisdickinson	i only went to cascadia
2013-06-04 15:30:16	Wraithan	osbridge is easily my favorite conf each year
2013-06-04 15:31:09	dlmanning	We seriously need to do a tacoconf in PDX
2013-06-04 15:31:42	dlmanning	Or maybe a beerConf
2013-06-04 15:31:49	Wraithan	dlmanning: last year there was an organized ride during osbridge
2013-06-04 15:32:02	Wraithan	to ride down to the carts, get lunch then go to the waterfront and hang out
2013-06-04 15:32:04	Wraithan	then ride back
2013-06-04 15:32:27	dlmanning	Sounds cool
2013-06-04 15:32:46	dlmanning	SF has a beerjs meetup
2013-06-04 15:32:48	Wraithan	My buddy onewheelskyward organized it
2013-06-04 15:33:35	Wraithan	I remember what a PR shitshow Ruby on Ales was for their community... I wonder if that stuff has cooled it
2013-06-04 15:33:48	chrisdickinson	what was the deal with that?
2013-06-04 15:34:08	 *	chrisdickinson only vaguely remembers
2013-06-04 15:34:20	dlmanning	With a name that awesome, what could go wrong?
2013-06-04 15:35:16	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: some conf got a bad rap a couple weeks before due to having a hangover brunch that served mimosas and started teh conf late
2013-06-04 15:35:36	Wraithan	then a dude said people who run confs are inconsiderate of people who don't drink
2013-06-04 15:35:41	Wraithan	then ruby on ales happened
2013-06-04 15:35:45	Wraithan	and make shit WAY worse
2013-06-04 15:36:23	chrisdickinson	:|
2013-06-04 15:36:27	dlmanning	...
2013-06-04 15:36:40	Wraithan	Yeah
2013-06-04 15:36:48	Wraithan	I mean it was stupid, right, but it happened
2013-06-04 15:37:21	Wraithan	http://ryanfunduk.com/culture-of-exclusion/
2013-06-04 15:37:22	dlmanning	Well NodeConf this year is totally gonna piss some people off
2013-06-04 15:37:28	Wraithan	I think was the blog post
2013-06-04 15:47:10	Wraithan	So I plan on sitting down this Saturday and taking a stab at the fxosify thing
2013-06-04 15:47:18	Wraithan	If anyone wants to cafe hack together
2013-06-04 15:47:59	hackygolucky	Wraithan: you're always welcome at 26 Cafe during the PyLadies hacktime :D
2013-06-04 15:48:18	Wraithan	Oh, cool
2013-06-04 15:48:21	Wraithan	yeah, that might work
2013-06-04 15:49:28	Wraithan	If I crash at my gf's house then it is only a 2mi ride
2013-06-04 15:49:37	Wraithan	maybe I'll do that
2013-06-04 15:49:59	 *	Wraithan has a hard time cycling more than a mile or so for hacking from his house
2013-06-04 15:50:06	Wraithan	I have too many good cafes right by me
2013-06-04 15:50:34	Wraithan	hackygolucky: not on calagator?

2013-06-04 15:55:48	Wraithan	np
2013-06-04 15:55:58	Wraithan	I mostly hate meetup but I understand the draw
2013-06-04 15:56:01	hackygolucky	I forget Calagator. And I shouldn't. I use meetup a ton and I don't like it.
2013-06-04 15:56:06	Wraithan	Prefer the nice open source solution
2013-06-04 15:56:10	hackygolucky	agreed.
2013-06-04 15:56:37	Wraithan	also on calagator means it gets put in the topic of #pdxtech
2013-06-04 15:56:53	Wraithan	the morning of the event
2013-06-04 15:58:21	hackygolucky	even better!
2013-06-04 16:04:08	Wraithan	Heh, Imma show up to pyladies and write js. Not a lady, not writing python, but oh well!
2013-06-04 16:04:31	 *	Wraithan blames hackygolucky
2013-06-04 16:05:05	hackygolucky	I'm not writing python then either, and I'm certainly not always a lady.
2013-06-04 16:05:11	hackygolucky	But everyone is welcome regardless!
2013-06-04 16:05:20	Wraithan	:D

2013-06-06 10:21:30	Wraithan	You didn't build any of these tools I am using (other than beefy which has understandable restrictions)
2013-06-06 10:21:52	chrisdickinson	yeah. the goal with beefy is for it to "fall away" once you need a real server
2013-06-06 10:21:59	chrisdickinson	(at which point you just use the browserify api directly)
2013-06-06 10:22:29	chrisdickinson	the gist above is for that middle point where you're just starting to need a server of your own
2013-06-06 10:22:36	chrisdickinson	if that makes sense.
2013-06-06 10:22:38	chrisdickinson	re: jade
2013-06-06 10:22:48	chrisdickinson	i've been taking a siesta from my projects for the last week or so
2013-06-06 10:23:18	chrisdickinson	maybe i should just take some time tonight at pdxnode/sepoconi and try to put together a jade transform for browserify
2013-06-06 10:23:23	chrisdickinson	and pr that in to jadeify
2013-06-06 10:31:58	Wraithan	Don't feel obligated
2013-06-06 10:32:03	chrisdickinson	eeh
2013-06-06 10:32:08	chrisdickinson	i need something tiny to get my feet wet again
2013-06-06 10:32:20	chrisdickinson	i feel really behind after not being online / programming for a week
2013-06-06 10:32:26	chrisdickinson	well, "non-work" programming
2013-06-06 10:42:46	Wraithan	In other news
2013-06-06 10:42:52	Wraithan	I wanna fight a QA guy at work
2013-06-06 10:42:56	chrisdickinson	sweet
2013-06-06 10:42:58	Wraithan	reopened 3  of my bugs
2013-06-06 10:43:03	chrisdickinson	get two knives and some tape

2013-06-06 10:43:14	Wraithan	2 of which with repo steps that include a view I deleted
2013-06-06 10:43:28	Wraithan	It is completely gone
2013-06-06 10:43:32	Wraithan	there is no way possible to get to it
2013-06-06 10:43:54	Wraithan	I'm getting a QA person I like to verify
2013-06-06 10:44:42	Wraithan	And it isn't that she is more lenient, but she is super detail oriented and will give me the actual repro steps
2013-06-06 10:44:52	 *	chrisdickinson nods
2013-06-06 10:45:41	Wraithan	It isn't that I want to be told I am right (well I do, but anyway), rather I want to be told exactly why I am wrong lol
2013-06-06 10:57:24	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: apparently this is all the transform needs to be. https://gist.github.com/chrisdickinson/dfb38ab634ffd278c0e7
2013-06-06 10:57:27	chrisdickinson	apparently.
2013-06-06 10:57:35	chrisdickinson	as in, "haven't tested it on much!"
2013-06-06 10:57:42	chrisdickinson	"but it looks like it supports includes!"

2013-06-07 10:32:34	dlmanning	sometimes I really miss stack backed programming languages
2013-06-07 10:39:39	s5fs	howdy gang
2013-06-07 10:40:09	s5fs	dlmanning: neat, i haven't published a node module yet, don't wanna pollute the ecosystem with "yet another" something.
2013-06-07 10:40:32	s5fs	whatcha gunna do with arrays?
2013-06-07 10:42:45	dlmanning	A transpose function
2013-06-07 10:43:11	dlmanning	For non-square, sparse, arbitrary data-type arrays
2013-06-07 10:43:53	s5fs	nice, that sounds fun
2013-06-07 10:44:19	dlmanning	It's an operation that I find myself needing a lot
2013-06-07 10:45:01	s5fs	interesting, i don't seem to work with arrays often in js right now

2013-06-07 10:45:10	s5fs	my data sets are really small, mostly message passing
2013-06-07 10:45:42	dlmanning	Yeah, I don't javascript right way
2013-06-07 10:45:59	dlmanning	^ the
2013-06-07 10:46:21	s5fs	haha!
2013-06-07 10:46:40	s5fs	i'm not sure what 'the right way' looks like so i cannot comment
2013-06-07 10:48:10	dlmanning	Seems to me like most people start on the human side and implement from there
2013-06-07 10:48:37	dlmanning	which makes a ton of sense and is probably better
2013-06-07 10:49:06	dlmanning	I like to think about the data
2013-06-07 10:49:06	s5fs	no plans to write asm.js by hand, eh?
2013-06-07 10:49:45	dlmanning	ha, I'm not a masochist.

2013-06-07 10:50:19	dlmanning	Abstractions are what make programming interesting
2013-06-07 10:50:33	dlmanning	Writing asm.js by hand would be boring as hell
2013-06-07 10:50:49	s5fs	oh for sure
2013-06-07 10:50:57	s5fs	developing tooling is fun, but on another level
2013-06-07 10:51:38	dlmanning	Do you do much of that?

2013-06-07 10:53:29	s5fs	not as much as i'd like
2013-06-07 10:54:08	s5fs	a long time ago i wrote a python scaffolding tool that ate xml and crapped out classes, caught the bug back then
2013-06-07 10:54:18	dlmanning	heh
2013-06-07 10:54:32	dlmanning	I'm getting a fun visual
2013-06-07 10:54:44	s5fs	we're doing a fair amount of network proramming where i'm at so i write a lot of simulators for things that are a bit difficult to mock using more convetional tools
2013-06-07 10:55:59	dlmanning	s5fs: You're Adam, right? With the red mutton-chops?
2013-06-07 10:56:06	s5fs	yes correct~
2013-06-07 10:56:33	s5fs	dlmanning: you gave a talk last night on es6, yes?
2013-06-07 10:56:43	dlmanning	Yeah. I'm the guy with a lot of red hair
2013-06-07 10:57:11	s5fs	very cool, it was fun learning more about es6
2013-06-07 10:57:32	s5fs	you have a great presentation style
2013-06-07 10:57:39	dlmanning	Oh thanks
2013-06-07 10:58:03	hackygolucky	oh! I had no idea s5fs was Adam.
2013-06-07 10:58:05	hackygolucky	Nice.
2013-06-07 10:58:18	s5fs	hackygolucky: thanks ;-)
2013-06-07 10:58:26	hackygolucky	and yeah, dlmanning you should offer your stand-up services for conferences.
2013-06-07 10:59:01	dlmanning	years of trying to keep community college students' attention in math classes
2013-06-07 10:59:04	hackygolucky	I forget to ask people their online handles if I actually remember to introduce myself.
2013-06-07 11:00:16	s5fs	hackygolucky: i know folks almost exclusively on irc, been trying to leave the house more often.
2013-06-07 11:02:52	dlmanning	hackygolucky: What's this about you guys putting on a conference?
2013-06-07 11:04:39	hackygolucky	dlmanning: the hubster wants to do a (un)conference of sorts--Neckbeard Conf
2013-06-07 11:04:45	hackygolucky	that's polyglot
2013-06-07 11:04:47	hackygolucky	mostly hacking
2013-06-07 11:04:58	hackygolucky	and a theme/focus for the hacking
2013-06-07 11:05:00	hackygolucky	here in Portland
2013-06-07 11:05:24	dlmanning	Sounds neat
2013-06-07 11:05:41	dlmanning	I'll stop shaving my neck
2013-06-07 11:05:54	hackygolucky	so justinabrahms met with thoward and chrisdickinson will meet with him another time due to scheduling conflicts to sort of get the ball rolling
2013-06-07 11:06:07	hackygolucky	dlmanning: I mean, me too. Can't say anything will result from that though.
2013-06-07 11:06:50	hackygolucky	I've offered my support and organization skills to help out.
2013-06-07 11:07:26	dlmanning	http://ohinternet.com/File:Ultimate_neckbeard.jpg
2013-06-07 11:07:50	s5fs	I'm aiming for a full beard but am not sure I have the credentials to back it
2013-06-07 11:07:57	dlmanning	Well I'd love to help out too if there's anything I can do.
2013-06-07 11:07:58	s5fs	until then, i have chops
2013-06-07 11:08:12	hackygolucky	whoa to the ultimate.
2013-06-07 11:08:40	s5fs	neckbeard conf/hack would be sweet
2013-06-07 11:16:43	s5fs	dlmanning: where are you teaching math, and what level courses are you instructing?
2013-06-07 11:17:38	dlmanning	s5fs: PCC Sylvania
2013-06-07 11:18:04	dlmanning	For the last term I've been teaching stats 1 and 2
2013-06-07 11:18:38	s5fs	dlmanning: yeah just looked you up :)
2013-06-07 11:18:38	dlmanning	I've taught there for about 6.5 years, and have done most of the sequence from Beginning Algebra to Calc IV at one time or another
2013-06-07 11:18:41	dlmanning	Ha
2013-06-07 11:19:27	s5fs	ah very cool
2013-06-07 11:19:53	dlmanning	yeah, it's been a good gig
2013-06-07 11:20:14	dlmanning	But I'm looking to move into development fulltime
2013-06-07 11:20:25	s5fs	tons of gigs available
2013-06-07 11:20:29	s5fs	(seems, anyways)
2013-06-07 11:20:35	Wraithan	yeah there are
2013-06-07 11:20:39	s5fs	if you havent heard, new relic is hiring
2013-06-07 11:20:48	s5fs	Wraithan: hey got your laptop back eh?
2013-06-07 11:21:12	dlmanning	Yeah. If my startup flops I hope people might still be hiring then :)
2013-06-07 11:21:16	Wraithan	going to head down and get it shortly
2013-06-07 11:21:52	dlmanning	But I've gotta at least launch our product before I go looking for other work
2013-06-07 11:21:57	hackygolucky	Wraithan: what a bummer! Got home last night and justinabrahms and I had a collective 'sigh' for you.
2013-06-07 11:23:12	s5fs	dlmanning: is the product something you can talk about or is it still super-secret?
2013-06-07 11:23:14	Wraithan	justinabrahms: ping me when you guys get that conf idea a bit more solid. I'll get noodles
2013-06-07 11:23:40	dlmanning	s5fs: You don't happen to work in the AEC industry do you?
2013-06-07 11:23:44	Wraithan	er Mozilla sponsorship
2013-06-07 11:23:53	s5fs	Wraithan: noodles are good
2013-06-07 11:23:58	Wraithan	silly phone
2013-06-07 11:24:43	s5fs	dlmanning: nah, i've been consulting, mostly in the energy sector but also product development, but not that industry.
2013-06-07 11:24:51	Wraithan	trying a new irc client on here. It is alright
2013-06-07 11:25:02	dlmanning	Wraithan: Not Weechat????
2013-06-07 11:25:19	Wraithan	yes weechat
2013-06-07 11:25:32	dlmanning	Isn't that the same client you always use?
2013-06-07 11:26:23	dlmanning	s5fs: Probably fine to mention then. It's an online training site for AEC. Tutorials, skill development, gamey elements
2013-06-07 11:26:30	Wraithan	using the experimental Android client that connects to my session and uses it as a relay
2013-06-07 11:27:10	dlmanning	Wraithan: Sounds pretty 31337
2013-06-07 11:27:18	Wraithan	lol
2013-06-07 11:27:39	dlmanning	:D
2013-06-07 11:27:40	Wraithan	more nerdy I can get the better
2013-06-07 11:28:39	s5fs	dlmanning: interesting, like CEU tracking and whatnot?
2013-06-07 11:29:31	dlmanning	s5fs: Well it's our own thing
2013-06-07 11:29:51	dlmanning	s5fs: But a part of our pitch to firms is quantifable training results
2013-06-07 11:30:16	s5fs	that's cool, seems like in some industries there is a lot of value in these types of systems
2013-06-07 11:30:25	dlmanning	"Your employees can now do this thing, this thing and that thing"
2013-06-07 11:31:08	dlmanning	s5fs: Well we're basically trying to undercut in-person consultancy
2013-06-07 11:31:32	dlmanning	which is ridiculously expensive
2013-06-07 11:31:53	s5fs	understood
2013-06-07 11:32:12	s5fs	even just focusing training and reducing the amt of on-site consulting time has real value
2013-06-07 11:32:41	s5fs	are you finding it to be a fun project?
2013-06-07 11:34:00	dlmanning	Well, I'm the sole developer
2013-06-07 11:34:15	dlmanning	Which means I can do things however I want
2013-06-07 11:34:23	dlmanning	That part is fun
2013-06-07 11:34:35	dlmanning	On the other hand... I'm the sole developer
2013-06-07 11:34:50	s5fs	yeah, its easy to develop bad habits flying solo for too long
2013-06-07 11:35:00	dlmanning	which means I have to figure out how to do everything
2013-06-07 11:35:38	s5fs	yup, thats where i am on this project, its basically me and a PM.
2013-06-07 11:35:48	dlmanning	I'm training another person to help out with frontend stuff, but he's just getting used to CSS
2013-06-07 11:35:59	dlmanning	So it's gonna be a little while
2013-06-07 11:36:00	s5fs	i'm training a guy on javascript but he's still getting used to unix
2013-06-07 11:36:11	s5fs	indeed!
2013-06-07 11:36:39	s5fs	i'm not great with front-end, it takes me twice as long as i expect and looks half as nice
2013-06-07 11:37:19	s5fs	dlmanning: sounds like a great deal of fun to me, haha
2013-06-07 11:37:26	dlmanning	It is, don't get me wrong
2013-06-07 11:37:29	dlmanning	I love it
2013-06-07 11:38:28	dlmanning	My partner--who actually started this company--does the design and graphics
2013-06-07 11:38:43	dlmanning	And that's definitely for the best
2013-06-07 11:39:33	dlmanning	I'm clueless when it comes to design
2013-06-07 11:39:41	s5fs	haha, same. i'm all fat crayons.
2013-06-07 11:40:10	dlmanning	*shrug* boxes? Maybe a border? I dunno
2013-06-07 11:41:58	s5fs	haha
2013-06-07 11:42:56	Wraithan	s5fs: story of my life about the twice as long/half as good
2013-06-07 11:43:02	Wraithan	front end is haaaaaaard
2013-06-07 11:43:33	Wraithan	dlmanning: round the corners and add a glass effect to the buttons!
2013-06-07 11:44:14	Wraithan	glow effects on mouse over for everything!
2013-06-07 11:44:19	Wraithan	and drop shadows on the text!
2013-06-07 11:45:36	s5fs	Wraithan: it's just the wrong kind of hard for me. i don't wanna fuss with what i consider "non-essentials" like button alignment
2013-06-07 11:47:55	dlmanning	Wraithan: and 0.5s transitions for everything!
2013-06-07 11:48:21	Wraithan	dlmanning: every time
2013-06-07 11:48:33	Wraithan	dlmanning: with random fade in style
2013-06-07 11:49:50	dlmanning	woot

2013-06-10 14:15:37	hackygolucky	every week, except once when I tried to move it to Backspace and didn't like the lack of pretty deck.
2013-06-10 14:16:11	hackygolucky	Wraithan: why do you ask?
2013-06-10 14:17:12	Wraithan	hackygolucky: just seeing how long this place had be around
2013-06-10 14:17:59	hackygolucky	It's my understanding it used to be another coffee shop. I think they were pretty new when we started going there.
2013-06-10 14:18:21	hackygolucky	I wonder if we could do PDXnode hacknight there....
2013-06-10 14:18:45	hackygolucky	the only space available at the new UA office is too massive.
2013-06-10 14:21:41	Wraithan	hackygolucky: well, once MozPDX is open we'll have good space for it
2013-06-10 14:21:55	s5fs	Wraithan: when is that supposed to happen?
2013-06-10 14:22:11	hackygolucky	Wraithan: that would be excellent. I <3 Mozilla
2013-06-10 14:22:41	Wraithan	and snacks and beer
2013-06-10 14:24:09	Wraithan	s5fs: 15th of July is our open, August is when we can start hosting things
2013-06-10 14:24:45	s5fs	Wraithan: very cool!
2013-06-10 14:25:57	Wraithan	We'll have an area with a bunch of tables as a big table, or we can break it out into smaller tables
2013-06-10 14:26:26	Wraithan	also, we'll see how the 'mobile work area' turns out, which is our area with couches and sofas and stuff
2013-06-10 14:26:37	s5fs	ah, just like home
2013-06-10 14:27:51	Wraithan	:)

2013-06-10 14:38:04	s5fs	just dreaming out loud
2013-06-10 15:22:27	Wraithan	recommended html templating in JS with very low number of absolute lines of code (includes deps)?
2013-06-10 15:25:30	Wraithan	Less lines means I can more easily include it with my firefox addon and have it not get me in trouble with reviewers
2013-06-10 15:27:09	justinabrahms	just use string concatenation. ^_^
2013-06-10 15:27:41	Wraithan	Yeah, that will get me rejeccted
2013-06-10 15:28:27	justinabrahms	https://github.com/janl/mustache.js -- highly reviewed templating language?
2013-06-10 15:28:57	 *	justinabrahms views "low numbers of code" as less important than 'reviewed by lots of smart people', usually.
2013-06-10 15:29:46	Wraithan	lower numbers of code means less code for reviewered to go through means less reason for them to reject me
2013-06-10 15:30:58	justinabrahms	I suppose that makes sense if they've not blessed a js templating language and don't like string concats.
2013-06-10 15:32:26	Wraithan	They have some libs blessed
2013-06-10 15:32:28	Wraithan	like jquery
2013-06-10 15:32:34	Wraithan	but I don't really want to use it lol

2013-06-11 12:01:45	dlmanning	For a non-I/O-bound function, should the default be sync or async?
2013-06-11 12:02:41	s5fs	dlmanning: i assume things are async unless told otherwise
2013-06-11 12:02:48	dlmanning	Like, if I'm providing both versions of the function
2013-06-11 12:03:02	s5fs	my vote is to default to async
2013-06-11 12:03:49	dlmanning	That's the way all the core stuff works, but most of it is I/O bound
2013-06-11 12:04:15	dlmanning	Seems strange to have the default version of an array operation be async
2013-06-11 12:05:45	s5fs	hm
2013-06-11 12:06:16	s5fs	i'm assuming that most folks aren't too concerned with how the module is implemented, so then it really becomes a question of what the consumer would expect
2013-06-11 12:10:02	dlmanning	So all my async version does anyway is run the transformation on nextTick
2013-06-11 12:10:13	dlmanning	Is that even worth doing
2013-06-11 12:12:27	s5fs	doesn't sound like you're getting much value for the effort expended
2013-06-11 12:12:58	dlmanning	hmm
2013-06-11 12:13:24	s5fs	if you can get the work done clearly w/o async i guess go for it
2013-06-11 12:13:58	dlmanning	You'd have to try to transform a big-ass array to notice anything... or be doing a lot of transforms
2013-06-11 12:15:01	dlmanning	Maybe I should just make a generic async scheduler for all the operations
2013-06-11 12:15:15	dlmanning	and leave the operations themselves as syncronous functions
2013-06-11 12:15:48	dlmanning	yeah... that sounds like more fun
2013-06-11 12:16:39	s5fs	haha, it does sound like more fun!

2013-06-14 13:25:31	 *	Wraithan has nothing to lose lol
2013-06-14 13:27:38	dlmanning	I'm not gonna point out the inconsistency between claiming not to use control-flow libraries while simultaneously pushing a control-flow methodology tightly wed to spec features
2013-06-14 13:28:05	Wraithan	you should though
2013-06-14 13:28:12	Wraithan	trust me it is soo much fun
2013-06-14 13:28:16	dlmanning	Oh I know
2013-06-14 13:29:11	dlmanning	But in recent years I've learned the dangers of having strong opinions around people you don't know well
2013-06-14 13:29:31	dlmanning	Or of openly contradicting powerful people when it isn't really important
2013-06-14 13:30:33	Wraithan	ah

2013-06-14 14:15:37	dlmanning	Right
2013-06-14 14:15:45	chrisdickinson	even streams2 got that right
2013-06-14 14:15:57	dlmanning	If you fracture the community you hurt everyone
2013-06-14 14:16:14	chrisdickinson	but yeah, i'm mostly just irritable at the moment because of the confluence of these various events
2013-06-14 14:16:57	chrisdickinson	DOMPromises being "standardized", the hilarity of es6, streams2 temporarily fracturing the node community such that new userland stream systems are appearing
2013-06-14 14:17:04	dlmanning	I mean, issacs said somewhere recently that if he had it to do over again he would make streams not inherit from event emitters.
2013-06-14 14:17:09	chrisdickinson	right!
2013-06-14 14:17:18	chrisdickinson	streams2 just caused a lot of problems.
2013-06-14 14:17:26	chrisdickinson	technically it's more correct
2013-06-14 14:17:35	chrisdickinson	or measurably better, i guess
2013-06-14 14:18:16	dlmanning	Welp. Time to learn Dart. I guess ;)
2013-06-14 14:18:21	chrisdickinson	oh god
2013-06-14 14:18:29	chrisdickinson	i actually started to read through their documentation
2013-06-14 14:18:34	dlmanning	It has "Futures" baked right in
2013-06-14 14:18:41	chrisdickinson	if it were *just* a language i'd probably be okay with it
2013-06-14 14:18:45	chrisdickinson	but holy god their standard lib
2013-06-14 14:19:00	chrisdickinson	"why don't JS people like a standard lib that's shares more with C++ than dynamic languages?!"
2013-06-14 14:19:05	chrisdickinson	*that
2013-06-14 14:19:08	chrisdickinson	man, typo day.
2013-06-14 14:19:44	dlmanning	Don't let it get you down, man. Just put on some autotuned whalesong and do your thing

2013-06-19 10:31:04	hackygolucky	dlmanning: what time is your flight?
2013-06-19 10:31:31	hackygolucky	we could share a ride but I'll assume there's a train in.

2013-06-19 10:37:23	hackygolucky	cool cool. I think Ben had said we could meet up at some point and all hitch a ride together to Eryn's
2013-06-19 10:37:34	hackygolucky	so I guess we need to exchange contact info
2013-06-19 10:38:13	dlmanning	yeah. We can work that out tomorrow perhaps

2013-07-08 14:56:28	dlmanning	They also have an auditorium that holds more, but it doesn't have tables or room to work
2013-07-08 14:56:41	hackygolucky_	I'm assuming once we announce at the meetup this Thursday it'll go fast.
2013-07-08 14:57:07	dlmanning	The only other thing I can think of is to look for space at Sylvania or Rock Creek campus
2013-07-08 14:57:18	dlmanning	They're bigger, but further out
2013-07-08 14:57:23	hackygolucky_	I'll try to eek out a response from UA by tomorrow.
2013-07-08 14:57:58	dlmanning	Okay, sorry there's not a bigger room
2013-07-08 14:58:03	thoward	hackygolucky_ dlmanning: what if we did the room and the auditorium. room is workspace, auditorium is general population
2013-07-08 14:58:25	dlmanning	thoward: What would people do in the auditorium?
2013-07-08 14:58:38	hackygolucky_	isn't everyone going to need workspace?
2013-07-08 14:59:01	thoward	depends. probably of people will just talk, hack on software, etc.
2013-07-08 15:00:03	dlmanning	I could ask tomorrow if the auditorium is available if that's something we want to look at
2013-07-08 15:02:05	thoward	a bigger workspace would be ideal, but available is good too at this point
2013-07-08 15:02:51	hackygolucky_	at the point we are looking at that size limit, walmart labs has the space and isn't charging.
2013-07-08 15:03:08	thoward	hackygolucky_: good point
2013-07-08 15:03:19	thoward	i think we should shoot for a larger venue
2013-07-08 15:03:23	hackygolucky_	I agree.
2013-07-08 15:03:27	s5fs	=1
2013-07-08 15:03:29	s5fs	whoops!!
2013-07-08 15:03:35	s5fs	make that a plus sign
2013-07-08 15:03:35	thoward	i bet we could rsvp > 50
2013-07-08 15:03:53	s5fs	that's a lotta folks
2013-07-08 15:04:07	hackygolucky_	That's why I'm holding my breath for UA. Plenty of room. Just need approval.
2013-07-08 15:04:18	s5fs	why bother with nodecopters at all?
2013-07-08 15:04:25	s5fs	if that's the limiting factor i say we drop 'em
2013-07-08 15:04:41	thoward	http://www.ecotrust.org/events/conference_center.html
2013-07-08 15:04:51	dlmanning	So we're passing on PCC campus options one way or another then?
2013-07-08 15:05:03	s5fs	thoward: know anyone at watershedpdx?
2013-07-08 15:05:06	thoward	and there's nothing on the schedule for that room on that day
2013-07-08 15:05:12	thoward	http://www.ecotrust.org/events/calendar.html
2013-07-08 15:05:12	s5fs	dlmanning: i vote to pass on the PCC campus
2013-07-08 15:05:24	thoward	s5fs: nope
2013-07-08 15:05:35	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: pass.
2013-07-08 15:05:41	thoward	agree, pass
2013-07-08 15:06:10	s5fs	thoward: okay, please put out a feeler if you could. i had access to the owner but never followed up b/c it's like for metalworkers or something
2013-07-08 15:06:15	dlmanning	Okie dokie, I shall cease and desist my efforts
2013-07-08 15:06:23	thoward	i'll call about ecotrust

2013-07-08 17:02:50	Wraithan	we can use s5fs's stuff for monitoring it, to make sure it stays hot enough so that it gets that wonderful pearly look
2013-07-08 17:03:59	thoward	basically one of these: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7tlHDsquVM
2013-07-08 17:04:01	thoward	but with node
2013-07-08 17:04:14	thoward	and smaller cause i don't make that much taffy (yet)

2013-07-08 17:11:06	thoward	pearlesence sensor?
2013-07-08 17:13:32	Wraithan	Well, most of that comes down to how hot it is when it starts and how it cools, right?
2013-07-08 17:14:04	jden	thoward: oh man, so many servos
2013-07-08 17:14:29	jden	the problem is, I'm getting the logical and the electrical part down, and then getting demotivated by the mechanical part
2013-07-08 17:14:38	jden	maybe I need to go back to Lego Mindstorms
2013-07-08 17:14:50	thoward	jden: mechanical is hard

2013-07-08 19:42:09	Wraithan	>>> choice(['JavaScript', 'Ruby', 'Python', 'Erlang', 'Go'])
2013-07-08 19:42:11	Wraithan	'Python'
2013-07-08 19:42:13	Wraithan	no bullshit, it totally did that
2013-07-08 19:42:17	thoward	lol
2013-07-08 19:43:01	Wraithan	thoward: the real answer: what ever one already has libraries to do most of the heavy lifting for you
2013-07-08 19:43:08	Wraithan	unless it is the heavy lifting you want to do
2013-07-08 19:43:21	Wraithan	in which case, what ever one already has the supporting libraries for you
2013-07-08 19:43:27	thoward	it is.
2013-07-08 19:44:46	thoward	basically -- i want to generalize the lucene query engine away from it's storage system. i think a ground up re-write woul dbe the most effective way to do that. the storage part is easy and there are tons of libs for that already. none that just generalize the query language parsing and query execution against an inverted index.
2013-07-08 19:45:03	thoward	i'm not writing it in Java, that's for fucking sure.
2013-07-08 19:45:24	thoward	when i ran your picker, it told me Go
2013-07-08 19:45:26	thoward	hehe
2013-07-08 19:45:52	thoward	i was leaning towards that as it compiles to native code.
2013-07-08 19:46:35	dlmanning	thoward: How about Rust?

2013-07-08 19:49:27	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: can I pipe to this from within the through write callback?
2013-07-08 19:49:59	chrisdickinson	hmm?
2013-07-08 19:50:56	dlmanning	through(function () { ... source.pipe(this) })
2013-07-08 19:52:44	dlmanning	Should work, yeah?
2013-07-08 19:53:06	chrisdickinson	i'm not sure that would be useful -- it would pipe to this through every time data was written?
2013-07-08 19:53:57	dlmanning	I'm attempting to wrap two transform streams within a through stream
2013-07-08 19:54:07	chrisdickinson	aaah
2013-07-08 19:54:20	dlmanning	for science :)
2013-07-08 19:54:32	chrisdickinson	i typically use http://npm.im/duplex in that case
2013-07-08 19:54:59	dlmanning	will try if this explodes in my face
2013-07-08 19:55:10	chrisdickinson	i've also heard good things about https://npmjs.org/package/duplexer

2013-07-08 23:40:23	thoward	if you need help w/ docker, let me know. i've been working with it a lot recently. (see: http://onbigonion.com and http://riakon.com
2013-07-08 23:41:29	Wraithan	thoward: nice, yeah, we have a couple contacts, including lxc and docker devs, but sitting down and seeing how you have stuff setup could be really valuable
2013-07-08 23:41:49	Wraithan	they both use(d) readthedocs
2013-07-08 23:42:51	thoward	i'm really glad the dotcloud folks open sourced it.
2013-07-08 23:43:50	Wraithan	thoward: well with people building stuff like what you just linked, it means they will have more 3rd party services to offer :)
2013-07-08 23:44:03	Wraithan	Not saying it wasn't for more pure reasons, just noting :)
2013-07-08 23:45:25	thoward	yep. enabling technologies are never bad for the market, but the definitely could have kept that stuff to themselves.
2013-07-08 23:45:56	thoward	for example -- cloud foundry has similar tech, which i extracted and was trying to build into a useful system like docker, right around the time docker came out.
2013-07-08 23:46:14	thoward	it was not easy, and wouldn't have been easy for anyone to pick it up. they went all out and made it easy and accessible.
2013-07-08 23:46:25	Wraithan	:) :)
2013-07-08 23:46:34	Wraithan	My sysadmin friends naysay docker
2013-07-08 23:46:48	thoward	yeah.. it's easy to poopoo on lxc
2013-07-08 23:46:49	Wraithan	They just see it as a super light wrapper around lxc
2013-07-08 23:47:00	Wraithan	well, that is the thing, they like lxc
2013-07-08 23:47:04	thoward	haha
2013-07-08 23:47:09	thoward	i don't like lxc
2013-07-08 23:47:21	Wraithan	They've grown on me
2013-07-08 23:47:22	thoward	i want to replace lxc w/ warden. lxc is slow. and a touch buggy
2013-07-08 23:47:34	Wraithan	I'm running like 20-30 lxc on my server right now
2013-07-08 23:47:37	thoward	sure
2013-07-08 23:47:38	Wraithan	slow/buggy?
2013-07-08 23:47:42	thoward	slow to startup
2013-07-08 23:47:46	Wraithan	oh, yeah
2013-07-08 23:47:50	Wraithan	totally noticed that
2013-07-08 23:48:01	Wraithan	but most of my containers are persistent
2013-07-08 23:48:17	thoward	warden can do the same tasks as lxc (and more) and spin up so fast that you can stick in your routing pipeline
2013-07-08 23:48:21	Wraithan	startup time <1min is basically good enough
2013-07-08 23:48:35	thoward	they don't have to be persistent. :) the less persistent they are, the more you can over sell a server
2013-07-08 23:48:43	Wraithan	heh
2013-07-08 23:48:49	Wraithan	my server is so underutilized
2013-07-08 23:49:24	thoward	for example: w/ warden, in a paas environment, you can have a router request come into a box, miss, spin up a warden container, and serve the request with only minimal percieved delay.
2013-07-08 23:49:39	Wraithan	That is pretty neat
2013-07-08 23:49:42	thoward	that same container is on a timeout. if it doesn't get anymore traffic in say.. 60 seconds, spin it down.
2013-07-08 23:49:44	Wraithan	I can totally see the need for stuff like that
2013-07-08 23:49:54	thoward	warden does that automatically
2013-07-08 23:50:10	thoward	if it wasn't fast to start, it couldn't be so cavalier about killing the containers
2013-07-08 23:51:37	thoward	anyhow.. lxc is also a bit buggy, as i've had containers fail to start/configure correctly, sort of at random, and also had them become inaccessible later on. not very often, but enough that it's worrisome
2013-07-08 23:54:16	thoward	i'm thinking of modifying docker to use warden instead of lxc.
2013-07-08 23:54:27	thoward	they are similar enough that it should be not too impossible.

2013-07-09 00:09:16	jden	Even a 1 minute download + startup time would mean faster deploys than what we've got now.

2013-07-09 14:49:31	Wraithan	I just realized piping two streams into one stream is a problem and I hadn't realized it!
2013-07-09 14:49:43	Wraithan	That is why dlmanning was talking about that yesterday
2013-07-09 14:50:02	Wraithan	dlmanning: what is the package you ended up making yesterday

2013-07-09 15:31:15	justinabrahms	I hope its called stream-hub.
2013-07-09 15:31:40	justinabrahms	You'd have to be careful that you don't have chunked responses, I think, as you could end up interleaving chunks.
2013-07-09 15:35:27	Wraithan	Yeah
2013-07-09 15:36:39	Wraithan	but dumping two object streams into a single stream would be safe
2013-07-09 15:38:11	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: you might be looking for pipe(target, {end: false})
2013-07-09 15:38:36	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: well, the problem would be figuring out when each of them ended
2013-07-09 15:38:58	Wraithan	there are a couple solutions
2013-07-09 15:39:08	chrisdickinson	Wraithan: if you don't pipe with {end: false} you'll get into a situation where the dest stream of both closes as soon as the first one closes
2013-07-09 15:39:18	Wraithan	chrisdickinson: I know
2013-07-09 15:39:39	Wraithan	That is what I was talking about when I realized there was a problem there
2013-07-09 15:40:37	chrisdickinson	kay
2013-07-09 15:41:31	chrisdickinson	was just pointing at the http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_pipe_destination_options as a possible route to fix that issue
2013-07-09 15:42:00	Wraithan	I could count the number of 'pipe' events and wait for that many end() calls
2013-07-09 15:42:07	Wraithan	and/or unpipe()
2013-07-09 15:42:13	Wraithan	er 'unpipe'
2013-07-09 15:42:32	Wraithan	basically ref counting
2013-07-09 16:15:37	hackygolucky_	alright! one sponsor confirmed :D
2013-07-09 16:30:05	hackygolucky_	hey #pdxnode if anyone is still interested in going to OSCON, there's a 20% discount code...

2013-07-09 16:32:38	hackygolucky_	there's also a code that'll get you into all the events/parties for free, which apparently you have to register to get?

2013-07-10 13:41:04	hackygolucky_	thoward: also, a sort of silly question:
2013-07-10 13:41:25	thoward	the best part about poopy puppy is the fire.
2013-07-10 13:41:42	hackygolucky_	once a sponsor has committed, what do you do to get the money? Do you generally have an information sheet you supply? Do they write a check?
2013-07-10 13:42:33	thoward	hackygolucky_: yup. i create an invoice and they pay it with a check, made out to "NodePDX", which i have a bank account/business setup for.
2013-07-10 13:43:27	hackygolucky_	I guess it is time to get that stuff set up.
2013-07-10 13:43:34	hackygolucky_	hrm
2013-07-10 13:53:14	thoward	hackygolucky_: we can just use the nodepdx account for this.
2013-07-10 13:53:32	thoward	i already have an invoicing system ready to roll

2013-07-10 15:11:19	hackygolucky_	Which I would very much be interested in. Just not this month. Sigh.
2013-07-10 15:11:32	JSON_voorhees	yeah, it is like 7 hours
2013-07-10 15:14:27	s5fs	just get a bow and head up into the woods
2013-07-10 15:17:23	s5fs	i mean, that's what john rambo would do

2013-07-10 15:31:34	hackygolucky_	I was thinking about the open range time.
2013-07-10 15:33:01	JSON_voorhees	oh yeah? I'll check into that. will they allow you to use their bows?
2013-07-10 15:33:29	s5fs	JSON_voorhees: i'd assume you can rent gear at the ranges, similar to gun ranges
2013-07-10 15:35:26	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: yeah they definitely have bows.
2013-07-10 15:35:35	hackygolucky_	I don't know what the rule is on using them though.

2013-07-10 15:41:01	s5fs	hackygolucky_: general structure is a couple of minutes on what is irc, why I find it valuable, why folks should use it, etc. the next few minutes will be a quick overview of how to get on irc (review of clients), basic commands, and a list of channels that are relevant to our shared interests.
2013-07-10 15:41:29	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i may forgo a slide deck entirely and just do a live presentation, actually climb on irc and join channels, etc.
2013-07-10 15:42:02	hackygolucky_	sounds good to me.
2013-07-10 15:42:11	s5fs	so i'm shooting for 10min and questions

2013-07-11 13:38:27	dlmanning	Do you guys read: http://prog21.dadgum.com/
2013-07-11 13:38:38	s5fs	however, we will have two high schoolers here for the summer so i'm hoping to learn from them
2013-07-11 13:38:46	hackygolucky_	it's definitely the type of phrase that comes up at PyLadies(lots of newbs)
2013-07-11 13:38:48	s5fs	dlmanning: yeah that guy is great, tons of little pearls in there
2013-07-11 13:39:15	dlmanning	s5fs: In such nice little digestible bits!
2013-07-11 13:39:34	s5fs	hackygolucky_: y'know, i'd be down for a 'stump the chump' type of talk, where folks just shout out questions and/or write down questions before the talk and we just rap about 'em
2013-07-11 13:39:40	s5fs	done right, it could be super beneficial
2013-07-11 13:39:49	s5fs	dlmanning: indeed
2013-07-11 13:40:02	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I like that.
2013-07-11 13:41:30	s5fs	hackygolucky_: the trick is creating an atmosphere where "dumb" questions can be asked w/o fear of embarassment
2013-07-11 13:41:40	hackygolucky_	yup yup.
2013-07-11 13:41:51	s5fs	dlmanning: i'm skimming his archives, here's a great one: http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html  these show up on HN from time to time
2013-07-11 13:41:59	hackygolucky_	one of the reasons pyladies exists.
2013-07-11 13:42:34	s5fs	it's a shame that philosophy doesn't exist as much in the masculine end of the code spectrum

2013-07-11 13:44:22	hackygolucky_	it's a hard battle. You end up having to speak up once in a while. People don't like to have to play that role.
2013-07-11 13:44:49	dlmanning	s5fs: Yeah, that's one a worry about sometimes
2013-07-11 13:44:50	hackygolucky_	And it's difficult to do in a diplomatic way without coming off as policing.
2013-07-11 13:45:20	s5fs	it's never fun to slap a hand
2013-07-11 13:45:31	hackygolucky_	yah.
2013-07-11 13:45:33	s5fs	nor is it fun to be slapped
2013-07-11 13:46:02	s5fs	i'd like to attend a pyladies just to learn the format. i'll ping you at some point, you organize right?
2013-07-11 13:47:11	dlmanning	It's a really difficult balance with an "open questions" format. It's tough to make it safe for honest if naive questions while still reigning in people who just want to talk
2013-07-11 13:47:42	hackygolucky_	s5fs: I do the hackdays. The workshops are almost exclusively Flora Worley and Selena Deckelmann.
2013-07-11 13:47:56	dlmanning	or even reining
2013-07-11 13:48:02	hackygolucky_	They are fantastic ladies, and especially under that guise, would certainly welcome you to the meetup.
2013-07-11 13:48:05	s5fs	dlmanning: agreed, i think smaller group settings work better
2013-07-11 13:48:38	dlmanning	That's always a challenge in math classes
2013-07-11 13:48:41	hackygolucky_	ah, another reason pyladies workshops fill up. Always have a small maximum.
2013-07-11 13:49:25	s5fs	hackygolucky_: i'm most interested in the community aspect, it sounds like you're doing a great job of building a really open and welcoming community. great job to all involved!

2013-07-11 13:50:35	hackygolucky_	was actually talking with a fellow PDXnoder about a ladies' group, but I waffle on the idea.
2013-07-11 13:50:47	hackygolucky_	don't know whether it is the best way to build.
2013-07-11 13:51:12	s5fs	personally i'm not in favor of gender-specific groups, i worry that it hinders progress as much as it helps
2013-07-11 13:51:23	hackygolucky_	Exactly.
2013-07-11 13:51:42	hackygolucky_	Most of the PyLadies also don't attend the Python user group meetups.
2013-07-11 13:51:51	hackygolucky_	which is...not the aim.
2013-07-11 13:52:09	s5fs	i'd be more in favor of hosting 'newbie night' or 'bring your dumb questions'
2013-07-11 13:52:24	s5fs	i want to promote equality while not dividing, something that's clearly a challenge
2013-07-11 13:52:52	hackygolucky_	I agree. I tend to have a visceral reaction to any smell of exclusivity, even out of good intention.
2013-07-11 13:52:58	s5fs	whats worse, i totally fucking blame dudes for this shit. damn our aggressive behavior, damn testosterone and damn popular media for reinforcing this bad behavior.

2013-07-11 17:37:16	s5fs	the goal (imho) is to encourage javascript use and it's all too easy to fall back on old ways that we know work, that's why it's hard sometimes to learn new stuff

2013-07-11 17:58:24	jden	and the theme is kind of around making hardware accessible to people. I happen to think JS is a pretty great way to do that, but maybe someone's more comfortable with other things?

2013-07-15 11:00:59	s5fs	jerrysv: good morning!
2013-07-15 11:01:30	s5fs	thoward: 13.04 sucks imho, I had to drop it in favor of 12.04 again (also, 12.10 still sucks too)
2013-07-15 11:15:20	hallettj	s5fs: Speaking of which, I read that 13.10 will introduce Mir, which is going to replace Xorg in stages over the next three releases.
2013-07-15 11:15:43	hallettj	It makes me wonder how my favorite non-Compiz window manager is going to deal with that.
2013-07-15 11:17:57	jerrysv	13.04 seems to work for me, but i just wanted updated packages for postgis stuff
2013-07-15 11:19:33	s5fs	jerrysv: i agree, the packages are feeling super dated in 12.04 but i'm okay building most stuff from source. i may leap distros but i'm unsure where to land yet, haha
2013-07-15 11:19:57	s5fs	hallettj: i'd expect someone will port, or we'll all just switch distros
2013-07-15 11:20:17	jerrysv	s5fs: i just wanted to build essentially a "worker" vm, i'll get the data out when i'm done and destroy it
2013-07-15 11:20:26	s5fs	(isn't that the open source default response, "fork it if you don't like it")
2013-07-15 11:21:09	s5fs	jerrysv: ah, gotcha. i'm running ubuntu as my host os.
2013-07-15 11:21:27	jerrysv	yeah, i run osx :)
2013-07-15 11:21:56	s5fs	i knew you were on apple hw but didn't inquire previously about os
2013-07-15 11:22:26	s5fs	apple aside, my only beef with osx is that i don't know it well enough to be very useful, and i'd rather not dork with plists all the time
2013-07-15 11:22:50	jerrysv	s5fs: 12 years ago i was required to run linux on the desktop - i'm an old unix guy and was in pain. switched to osx and never looked back
2013-07-15 11:23:10	chrisdickinson	man, CSS is such an elegant selector language
2013-07-15 11:24:02	s5fs	jerrysv: i cut my teeth on solaris and moved to linux before osx was viable. ran 10.1-10.3 and then abandoned the platform. too gui, not enough unixy base for my liking.
2013-07-15 11:24:39	s5fs	shit, i had to drop into single user mode and reset the admin passwd on a 10.6 install last week, took forever.

2013-07-15 11:42:00	s5fs	Wraithan: yeah, but outside of using a terminal and gnu utils, it's all pretty foreign
2013-07-15 11:42:22	Wraithan	s5fs: you need more?
2013-07-15 11:42:33	Wraithan	firefox, terminal, some music playing app
2013-07-15 11:42:49	s5fs	Wraithan: nah, not really, haha!
2013-07-15 11:43:29	Wraithan	And I only use editors that are cross platform
2013-07-15 11:43:31	s5fs	i stay with linux mainly because it's my target platform for all projects in the past few years, so i can shortcut some types of platform issues during dev that normally wouldn't show up until testing on-platform

2013-07-15 11:44:30	s5fs	good example is mdns, it works totally different on osx (bonjour) than on linux (avahi)
2013-07-15 11:44:54	s5fs	well, not totally different, but i've had issues in the past
2013-07-15 11:44:57	Wraithan	true
2013-07-15 11:45:51	s5fs	mainly it's systems tasks that i can't perform that bothers me about osx, but again, that's an issue of my lack of knowledge, not a shortcoming in the platform as a whole
2013-07-15 11:46:05	s5fs	it seems that most webdevs are on osx, that alone speaks for it's technical ability
2013-07-15 11:46:47	s5fs	windows is still the outlier on webdev though, i prefer platform integration beyond what putty provides
2013-07-15 11:46:59	s5fs	(or sfu or cygwin)

2013-07-15 20:28:43	JSON_voorhees	that techno-activism meeting looks pretty cool, wish i would have seen it 2 hours ago :(
2013-07-15 21:29:44	jden	oh man, Streams2 are just silly. Officially.
2013-07-15 21:30:25	dlmanning	elaborate
2013-07-15 21:31:14	jden	they're fine if you're only composing them using .pipe()
2013-07-15 21:32:01	jden	but if you're trying to do anything more elaborate in terms of coordination or interleaving or what have you, the janky factor is much higher than the old interface
2013-07-15 21:33:25	dlmanning	the janky factor
2013-07-15 21:34:24	dlmanning	So you're trying to send multiple streams into a single write stream, or what?
2013-07-15 21:36:34	jden	trying to split a duplex stream into separate read and write streams
2013-07-15 21:37:46	dlmanning	to what end?
2013-07-15 21:38:52	jden	to extend a transform stream
2013-07-15 21:39:45	dlmanning	Why not just implement stream.Transform?
2013-07-15 21:40:27	dlmanning	or perhaps I'm misunderstanding you
2013-07-15 21:42:07	dlmanning	Or have you got two sequential transforms that you're trying to wrap?
2013-07-15 21:42:33	jden	So, basically the case that npm.im/duplexer solves in classic streams
2013-07-15 21:43:28	jden	but in reverse, I suppose. Pulling a duplex stream into Read and Write streams
2013-07-15 21:44:17	jden	so D -> [R, W] -> (stuff) -> [R, W] -> D
2013-07-15 21:45:23	dlmanning	And this isn't just a transform?
2013-07-15 21:50:44	jden	Well, but I want to return a second duplex stream, that subsequent things can write to and don't go through the first transform
2013-07-15 21:50:55	jden	so conceptually yes, but stream.Transform doesn't help as a base class
2013-07-15 21:51:17	dlmanning	Ah
2013-07-15 21:51:31	jden	I just need to re-build my go-to libraries for Streams2
2013-07-15 21:51:51	jden	I get what it was trying to solve, but those weren't the problems I was having in classic streams
2013-07-15 21:51:57	 *	jden stops being old and bitter
2013-07-15 21:52:00	dlmanning	I rewrote stream-concat and through with Streams2
2013-07-15 21:52:58	jden	We should PR the upstream authors with 2.0 versions - like https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream/issues/8
2013-07-15 21:53:32	dlmanning	I know dominictarr isn't interested in updating, not sure about max
2013-07-15 21:55:15	dlmanning	probably easier just to pubish independent versions

2013-07-16 10:52:29	chrisdickinson	if there's an `if` statement that's the only child of a parent, and it has an alternate case, suggest dropping the alternate and returning early from the consequent instead

2013-07-16 10:53:25	chrisdickinson	the `[alternate]` there is a bit showy

2013-07-16 14:11:17	chrisdickinson	and just get people to write the linter module of their dreams by combining tiny little other modules to check specific things

2013-07-17 12:40:19	chrisdickinson	good to be aware of them and how they work, i suppose

2013-07-17 16:09:04	dlmanning	^^ In case anyone wants a good reason to roll their eyes about promises
2013-07-17 16:10:31	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: I feel like promises is one of those things that I need to learn. I feel like being resistant at this point will only put me behind if(and looking more like 'when') they become generally accepted.
2013-07-17 16:14:49	chrisdickinson	the thing is, there's not a lot to learn, really.
2013-07-17 16:16:03	dlmanning	For some reason, promises make me think of this scene from Dumb and Dumber: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GSXbgfKFWg
2013-07-17 16:16:18	chrisdickinson	it's more of a difference in preference over varying levels of api sugar
2013-07-17 16:16:31	chrisdickinson	or more accurately, different taste in apis

2013-07-17 16:18:07	dlmanning	I'm interested to see if there end up being any significant performance differences once promises get optimized
2013-07-17 16:20:05	hackygolucky_	heh
2013-07-17 16:20:54	chrisdickinson	i feel the need to rephrase: it's totally worth being familiar with promises, but they are not a foregone conclusion in web/node.js development
2013-07-17 16:22:20	chrisdickinson	dlmanning: i imagine the net effect will be a minor amount of extra garbage generation
2013-07-17 16:22:52	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: That makes sense. Extra objects

2013-07-18 09:59:07	hackygolucky_	Nice!
2013-07-18 09:59:10	Birdbones	1) He has an impetus to work out every day, someone is counting on him showing up.
2013-07-18 09:59:21	Birdbones	2) He gets paid instead of paying dues.
2013-07-18 09:59:22	hackygolucky_	We had a friend in SC who was a web developer and did the same thing.
2013-07-18 09:59:29	hackygolucky_	He lost so much weight bicycle delivery driving.

2013-07-18 10:26:17	chrisdickinson	well, the second is really, extremely optional
2013-07-18 10:26:21	chrisdickinson	but falafel is great great great
2013-07-18 10:31:26	chrisdickinson	the selector in cssauron would be something like `call > id[name=define] + array + function` -- that'll give you all nodes matching that. walk up from the node that matches to `call`. mark it for rewriting
2013-07-18 10:31:26	chrisdickinson	â€¦ code will be more understandable

2013-07-18 10:49:15	adamdicarlo	there's a ton of pinball in portland. just hit me yesterday when i visited http://pinballmap.com/portland for the first time.
2013-07-18 10:49:41	hackygolucky_	holy smokes.
2013-07-18 10:50:13	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: yeah, I have problems in other cities because if I go out drinking with a group... I tend to get burnt out and want to do something solo in my head, my solution in portland is to go play a little pinball
2013-07-18 10:50:55	adamdicarlo	hee hee, awesome solution. especially if you're at slabtown, moonshine, ... or of course ground kontrol :)
2013-07-18 10:51:41	Wraithan	adamdicarlo: Most bars I go to have at least 1 machine
2013-07-18 10:52:09	Wraithan	Even if it isn't a machine I like, dropping 2 bucks into it and sitting inside my head for a bit is very revitalizing
2013-07-18 10:52:20	 *	adamdicarlo nods
2013-07-18 10:52:30	adamdicarlo	good introvert socialization strategy!
2013-07-18 10:53:36	Wraithan	I would say, on the scale of intro to extra -vert, I'm on the extra side. I am also just more sensitive to what I need to feel more comfortable
2013-07-18 10:57:41	justinabrahms	chrisdickinson: so I was actually thinking that something like "jquery for ast's" would be neat. Sounds like you made that. :)
2013-07-18 10:57:53	justinabrahms	this was the awful code I ended up writing: https://gist.github.com/justinabrahms/6027925
2013-07-18 10:58:11	justinabrahms	completely procedural with no separation.
2013-07-18 10:59:04	adamdicarlo	Wraithan, i'm with you there. I think I'm ~65% extrovert.. can easily hit the socialization overload.
2013-07-18 10:59:19	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: https://gist.github.com/chrisdickinson/5b8c83cec78bf512ba1c
2013-07-18 10:59:40	chrisdickinson	mine's not much more elegant :)
2013-07-18 11:00:10	chrisdickinson	usage is basically `cat file-to-rewrite | rewrite-js this-gist.js`
2013-07-18 11:01:22	chrisdickinson	(make sure you have rewrite-js 0.0.1 if you're using node >=0.10)
2013-07-18 11:03:04	chrisdickinson	and yeah, i really need to get around to writing a jquery-alike for asts
2013-07-18 11:03:16	chrisdickinson	i've got the selector language and everything, and it would clean up so much of my code :|
2013-07-18 11:03:28	chrisdickinson	that's actually what the linter i just released was going to be -- `ast-query` :|
2013-07-18 11:03:38	chrisdickinson	sorry for the preponderance of blank expressions.
2013-07-18 11:04:04	thoward	chrisdickinson: this is funny. last night around 1am, i was thinking that i wanted to write a generalized version of jquery selectors as a query language standard for tree-like structures.
2013-07-18 11:04:25	chrisdickinson	serendipity!
2013-07-18 11:04:36	chrisdickinson	or synecdoche?
2013-07-18 11:04:57	chrisdickinson	(or probably neither)
2013-07-18 11:05:47	thoward	haha, seredipity, indeed. so.. explain me this cssauron thing.
2013-07-18 11:06:38	thoward	"matching function in css" doesn't actually make sense, per se. :)
2013-07-18 11:06:43	chrisdickinson	ah
2013-07-18 11:06:50	hackygolucky_	I'm glad I hang around you guys. Eventually I hope to soak some of this up. You know, coming up with these ideas at 1am...
2013-07-18 11:07:16	chrisdickinson	so, css selectors can express a "test" function -- "does this node match this selector or not"
2013-07-18 11:07:37	chrisdickinson	(lemme know if i'm explaining from the wrong place, also)
2013-07-18 11:08:34	chrisdickinson	a css selector basically gives you a yes/no function for each node in the tree. it works by going from the right hand side of the selector (at the current node), and traversing back to the left of the selector (as written)
2013-07-18 11:08:44	thoward	chrisdickinson: well, i guess the question is, why are we calling it "CSS" anything, since it has nothing to do with style-sheets. :)
2013-07-18 11:08:44	chrisdickinson	so it also has the nice property of failing early
2013-07-18 11:08:56	chrisdickinson	it's modeled after the css selector language
2013-07-18 11:09:00	thoward	gotcha
2013-07-18 11:09:14	thoward	like jquery
2013-07-18 11:09:20	 *	chrisdickinson looks at his own readme and weeps
2013-07-18 11:09:28	chrisdickinson	(i need to rephrase it!)
2013-07-18 11:09:31	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-07-18 11:10:01	chrisdickinson	cssauron exposes an api that takes an object that describes a set of traversal operations
2013-07-18 11:10:15	justinabrahms	you might also call it XLT, but with a different syntax
2013-07-18 11:10:26	chrisdickinson	basically, you tell cssauron where to look to get a node's children, parent, tag name, etc
2013-07-18 11:10:41	justinabrahms	or maybe I mean xslt?
2013-07-18 11:10:43	chrisdickinson	and it gives you back a function that takes selectors and gives you matching functions
2013-07-18 11:10:46	 *	justinabrahms doesn't even xml.
2013-07-18 11:10:51	chrisdickinson	justinabrahms: i always get it mixed up
2013-07-18 11:11:12	thoward	so what i wanted to formalize was this: language constructs that describe jquery/css style selectors, a PEG/BNF spec for that, a parser implementation, and an API specification to implement.
2013-07-18 11:11:46	thoward	i was going to call it "treacle"
2013-07-18 11:11:54	thoward	EG: Tree-QL
2013-07-18 11:12:04	justinabrahms	http://docs.activestate.com/activetcl/8.4/tcllib/treeql/treeql.html
2013-07-18 11:12:40	chrisdickinson	i want: a PEG/BNF parser that generates streaming parsers
2013-07-18 11:12:56	justinabrahms	xpath is the thing I was thinking of.
2013-07-18 11:13:35	justinabrahms	so you're basically wanting to build xpath with a better API?
2013-07-18 11:13:40	thoward	chrisdickinson: totes. you saw the stuff tim was doing w/ composable streaming json parser?
2013-07-18 11:13:44	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-07-18 11:13:53	thoward	justinabrahms: well, with a better language.
2013-07-18 11:14:22	thoward	of course, when i say "thinking about this at 1am" i mean "i didn't google to see if it exists yet or not". :P
2013-07-18 11:14:36	chrisdickinson	his composable streaming parser is a much less baroque version of what i was doing with my inflate implementation
2013-07-18 11:14:53	chrisdickinson	"state machine where the states are just functions"
2013-07-18 11:15:55	thoward	chrisdickinson: i think you could generalize a lot of that to be used in a PEG parser generator.. problem then comes with the custom embeded stuff. how to ensure that remains reentrant/stateless?
2013-07-18 11:16:57	thoward	justinabrahms: imo, the input language is key. for example, compare google's input vs SQL vs a fluent code api.
2013-07-18 11:17:26	justinabrahms	graph db query languages might be a reasonable place to look.
2013-07-18 11:17:43	thoward	well most of them parrot SQL, which is think sucks.
2013-07-18 11:18:07	chrisdickinson	thoward: ah, embedding a parser inside of the parser?
2013-07-18 11:19:43	thoward	chrisdickinson: yep. so in PEG, you can embed target language functions, which is goofy. see my lucene query syntax parser: https://github.com/thoward/lucene-query-parser.js
2013-07-18 11:20:22	thoward	you can put whatever arbitrary code you want in there.
2013-07-18 11:20:35	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-07-18 11:20:45	chrisdickinson	just like yacc / bison
2013-07-18 11:20:52	chrisdickinson	slash jison
2013-07-18 11:21:06	chrisdickinson	return promises
2013-07-18 11:21:09	chrisdickinson	</troll>
2013-07-18 11:21:44	chrisdickinson	(though in reality this would be a great api to map to continuables i think)
2013-07-18 11:26:02	thoward	chrisdickinson: agree
2013-07-18 11:26:39	chrisdickinson	thoward: so, the approach i'm taking with cssauron is to decouple the specifics of tree traversal from the language itself -- so that to get the selector language, you have to first tell cssauron some bare minimum details about your tree/node structure
2013-07-18 11:26:48	chrisdickinson	would you take a similar approach or would this be more generalized?
2013-07-18 11:27:50	chrisdickinson	(the side effect of my approach is that if a particular operation isn't supported i drop some operations from the language)
2013-07-18 11:28:21	chrisdickinson	(if there's no `children` operation defined you don't get sibling selectors, or the :first-child / :last-child pseudoclasses, for example)
2013-07-18 11:30:41	thoward	chrisdickinson: i would not do it that way. i would test each node. remember: dynamic language. it might have children one second, then not have it the next. :)
2013-07-18 11:31:07	thoward	it's up to the user to imply the structure in the query
2013-07-18 11:32:20	chrisdickinson	thoward: hmm? as in, your nodes may have children one second, and then have children located at a different attribute a second later?
2013-07-18 11:32:43	thoward	chrisdickinson: yup.
2013-07-18 11:33:01	chrisdickinson	you cannot see it but i am squinting at my monitor
2013-07-18 11:33:04	chrisdickinson	:)
2013-07-18 11:34:00	thoward	i guess my point is that what we want to traverse should be specified in the query, not in the data structure or in the parser.
2013-07-18 11:34:07	chrisdickinson	ahh
2013-07-18 11:34:10	chrisdickinson	i see.
2013-07-18 11:34:26	chrisdickinson	you want a fully generalized tree language
2013-07-18 11:34:30	thoward	yup
2013-07-18 11:34:31	chrisdickinson	cssauron is not that
2013-07-18 11:34:39	chrisdickinson	(i see now)
2013-07-18 11:34:59	thoward	so jquery is close, but probably needs some minor tweaks to extend it for general use.
2013-07-18 11:35:34	chrisdickinson	so the problem is that css-style selector languages walk from the right to the left, generally from the node to the node's parents
2013-07-18 11:35:42	chrisdickinson	which is where they get a large bit of their expressiveness
2013-07-18 11:35:56	chrisdickinson	and the other nice property of not having to have the entire tree loaded into memory at the time a node is being tested
2013-07-18 11:36:51	chrisdickinson	the "sibling" operations are really just traversing to parent, then traversing to children of parent
2013-07-18 11:36:56	thoward	well all it really requires is specifying the direction of descent when a branch has to be traversed, and maintaining the path of that descent until the query is resolved.
2013-07-18 11:37:00	chrisdickinson	then all other traversals are either direct or indirect parent
2013-07-18 11:37:31	chrisdickinson	css becomes a lot less attractive as a selector language base when running from the left to the right, i think
2013-07-18 11:38:17	thoward	or, instead of maintaining the state, trade mem for proc, and re-traverse (because it's deterministic) to fin dparent, but stop a node earlier.
2013-07-18 11:39:22	thoward	if you index the tree structure (b-tree, etc) before operation, then it's even easier
2013-07-18 11:39:29	thoward	well faster
2013-07-18 11:40:22	thoward	and you can do a selective index of only the graph of relations that are needed by the query. and discard that when the query is done.
2013-07-18 11:40:23	chrisdickinson	so an example query might look like "x -(via 'child')-> y", or "x --(via each 'child')-> z", where those would be represented as 'x > y' and 'x y' in css?
2013-07-18 11:46:54	thoward	right, so instead of "x > y" it would be "x [children]> y" or something (eg, the attribute 'children
2013-07-18 11:47:09	thoward	instead of an impied structure, it's specified
2013-07-18 11:47:23	thoward	allowing you to traverse a number of different kinds of paths
2013-07-18 11:47:44	chrisdickinson	interesting
2013-07-18 11:48:08	chrisdickinson	so in cssauron you would just come up with two different languages that both described the nodes. it would be interesting to see how they could be interleaved
2013-07-18 11:48:14	thoward	and if a node doesn't have an attr named 'children' it just skips it, vs erroring
2013-07-18 11:48:24	chrisdickinson	because really you're talking about one set of edges at a time when it comes to cssauron
2013-07-18 11:48:51	thoward	also interesting is that traversal doesn't NEED to be bijective.
2013-07-18 11:49:30	chrisdickinson	actually i suppose cssauron operates on two kinds of graph edges: parents and children
2013-07-18 11:49:37	chrisdickinson	which may not necessarily be the same relation
2013-07-18 11:49:39	thoward	if you remove the assumption that p->c allows c->p then you can easily query a graph. even a cyclic graph.
2013-07-18 11:49:45	chrisdickinson	right
2013-07-18 11:49:57	chrisdickinson	so, the sibling selectors assume that, but no other selector
2013-07-18 11:50:11	thoward	exactly
2013-07-18 11:50:12	chrisdickinson	however it does assume the graph has a terminal node -- like the dom
2013-07-18 11:50:17	chrisdickinson	which would be incorrect
2013-07-18 11:50:40	thoward	yeah, it should only require an entry node and a stop in specification
2013-07-18 11:50:59	chrisdickinson	again, it's an artifact of walking right-to-left
2013-07-18 11:51:10	chrisdickinson	cssauron is basically designed for json-parse-stream
2013-07-18 11:51:14	chrisdickinson	or glsl-stream
2013-07-18 11:51:26	chrisdickinson	anything where tokens are emitted on a stream, depth-first
2013-07-18 11:51:48	chrisdickinson	i.e., trees, not graphs, and incomplete trees at that, usually
2013-07-18 11:54:11	thoward	so the constraint there is that you cannot re-traverse
2013-07-18 11:56:02	chrisdickinson	weeeelll
2013-07-18 11:56:05	chrisdickinson	:any()
2013-07-18 11:56:33	chrisdickinson	and if i were feeling particularly capricious, :all() could be added
2013-07-18 11:56:57	chrisdickinson	which would traverse up to the :any selector node, then branch traversals from there
2013-07-18 11:57:06	chrisdickinson	(commas also allow multiple traversals)
2013-07-18 11:57:09	chrisdickinson	i suppose
2013-07-18 11:57:33	chrisdickinson	though only on those implied attributes, which isn't what you want
2013-07-18 11:57:45	justinabrahms	https://cs.nyu.edu/~lharris/content/programquerylangs.html
2013-07-18 11:57:45	chrisdickinson	(unless i'm misunderstanding "retraverse" in this case)

2013-07-18 12:08:11	justinabrahms	2002.. I think they predate it. :)
2013-07-18 12:08:15	justinabrahms	and likely don't care.
2013-07-18 12:08:17	justinabrahms	:-P
2013-07-18 12:08:34	thoward	that's pretty cool

2013-07-18 12:12:20	justinabrahms	cool. stack overflow careers just sent me an intro to a CEO of a company who's looking for django things.
2013-07-18 12:12:35	justinabrahms	"like YouTube for surgeons". Actually sounds pretty neat. :)
2013-07-18 12:12:50	<--	AWinterm_ (~AWinterma@67.131.102.78) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-07-18 12:12:54	justinabrahms	and it's also completely non-spammy.
2013-07-18 12:12:58	chrisdickinson	awesome
2013-07-18 12:13:14	chrisdickinson	"like youtube comments for surgeons" is a much less served need i think.
2013-07-18 12:13:43	thoward	also consider traversal notation like foo.bar == 1 vs foo..bar == 1 (foo, attribute called bar that's eq to 1) vs (foo, all attributes, where the attribute is an object that has an attribute called bar that is eq to 1)
2013-07-18 12:14:14	chrisdickinson	that's pretty elegant
2013-07-18 12:14:46	JSON_voorhees	jake weary yes
2013-07-18 12:15:46	thoward	justinabrahms: is that Bright.md ?
2013-07-18 12:16:15	thoward	i was considering applying as well.

2013-07-18 12:16:30	justinabrahms	see my latest tweet
2013-07-18 12:18:01	thoward	pretty typical. i usually looking for them to specifically call out something i've done in a non-templatable manner.
2013-07-18 12:19:18	thoward	a, imo, more interesting opportunity is: http://bright.md/jobs/
2013-07-18 12:20:07	thoward	here's their pitch video http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8Tmpr4UwesE
2013-07-18 12:20:23	thoward	it's like skype for doctors. :)
2013-07-18 12:20:29	thoward	or something
2013-07-18 12:23:03	thoward	if the basho interview process doesn't work out, i might go apply for that vpEng job.

2013-07-18 13:46:41	chrisdickinson	of course, my library is named after a giant fiery eyeball so i care a lot less about sensibility, evidently
2013-07-18 13:46:41	thoward	i guess i don't see why :any is needed.. vs just a grouping operator.
2013-07-18 13:46:58	thoward	so you can already do OR lists..
2013-07-18 13:47:19	thoward	ol, ul, dir, menu { /*...*/ }
2013-07-18 13:47:39	chrisdickinson	:any *is* the grouping operator in this case
2013-07-18 13:47:50	thoward	so why can't that be: (ol, ul, dir, menu), (ol, ul, dir, menu) (etc)
2013-07-18 13:48:10	chrisdickinson	i can only theorize
2013-07-18 13:48:11	thoward	i guess because backwards compatibility
2013-07-18 13:48:28	chrisdickinson	well, no, :any is going to be just as invalid a selector as `(`
2013-07-18 13:49:07	thoward	so () doesn't have any historical meaning?
2013-07-18 13:49:16	chrisdickinson	afaik, no
2013-07-18 13:49:46	thoward	yeah, then it should be an implicit any. :)
2013-07-18 13:50:28	chrisdickinson	i'm sure there's a reason out there on a mailing list somewhere
2013-07-18 13:50:34	thoward	i guess also, there's no inverse for "," operator
2013-07-18 13:50:48	chrisdickinson	an :all, you mean?
2013-07-18 13:50:52	thoward	so how to express AND vs OR ... they choose peer level :all/:any
2013-07-18 13:51:05	thoward	yeah
2013-07-18 13:51:52	chrisdickinson	well, there's no :all in css :)
2013-07-18 13:52:02	JSON_voorhees	*
2013-07-18 13:52:03	chrisdickinson	you could pair :not's
2013-07-18 13:52:04	thoward	in lucene's query syntax the implicit operator (space) means "AND", with or being explicit via ("OR" or "|")
2013-07-18 13:52:12	thoward	ugh
2013-07-18 13:52:13	chrisdickinson	JSON_voorhees: well, "all of these selectors must match this node"
2013-07-18 13:52:23	JSON_voorhees	ahh
2013-07-18 13:56:46	thoward	i find it odd that css choose "here's a list of selectors, group them and apply AND/OR into a single selector), vs typical right/left operator semantics.
2013-07-18 13:59:33	jden	oh no, did I just walk into a discusson on CSS selectors?
2013-07-18 13:59:52	jden	They're the JavaScript of predicate DSLs
2013-07-18 14:00:40	jden	absolutely terrible in every way, except they're everywhere and already well known, so that makes them valuable
2013-07-18 14:01:09	thoward	it like :or(a,b,c) vs (a|b|c) which is implemented as an arity-2 func; or(r,l) with currying when combined, so that's or(or(a,b),or(b,c))
2013-07-18 14:01:13	chrisdickinson	aw no, css selectors are great
2013-07-18 14:01:25	thoward	jden: i'm trying to reason through why they are preferrable
2013-07-18 14:02:13	thoward	probably because the semantics lead ease of implementation as a filter vs a decision tree
2013-07-18 14:02:32	jden	ah, that's true
2013-07-18 14:02:33	thoward	no recursion
2013-07-18 14:02:38	chrisdickinson	also because the language lends itself well to selecting nodes coming out of a depth first stream
2013-07-18 14:02:49	chrisdickinson	there's no "selecting forward"
2013-07-18 14:03:04	chrisdickinson	if that makes sense.
2013-07-18 14:04:56	thoward	chrisdickinson: yep
2013-07-18 14:05:59	thoward	so how do the aggregate functions work? like :first-child
2013-07-18 14:07:00	chrisdickinson	in cssauron they're specially implemented
2013-07-18 14:07:07	chrisdickinson	basically, :first-child is easy to tell
2013-07-18 14:07:40	chrisdickinson	because there are no preceding nodes (up to parent, down to children, children.length == 1 && true)
2013-07-18 14:08:02	chrisdickinson	:last-child is really only reasonable if it's a non-streaming depth-first thing
2013-07-18 14:08:19	chrisdickinson	because, well, you can't ever tell if you're the last child. that implies being able to predict the future
2013-07-18 14:08:39	chrisdickinson	so that one's a bitâ€¦ useless in streaming cases
2013-07-18 14:08:49	chrisdickinson	:empty is easy
2013-07-18 14:09:11	chrisdickinson	:contains("blah") is sort of a gloss -- inherited from html being visual markup
2013-07-18 14:09:52	chrisdickinson	:root is "no parent link"
2013-07-18 14:10:31	chrisdickinson	^^ the above is to be sung to the tune of the animaniacs 50 states song.
2013-07-18 14:10:34	thoward	nice
2013-07-18 14:11:09	thoward	well, :last-child can be evaluated once the stream ends, assuming the stream supports the idea of ending
2013-07-18 14:11:33	thoward	but memory cost
2013-07-18 14:11:55	chrisdickinson	yeah, that defeats the purpose because then you've gotta keep nodes around that you couldn't "match"
2013-07-18 14:12:13	chrisdickinson	the idea is that the nodes come out as they "finish" -- sort of as they're popped off the stack
2013-07-18 14:12:26	chrisdickinson	so the stream is "nodes over time"
2013-07-18 14:12:51	thoward	agreed.. well.. you buffer anything that would match (subset of all) until stream ends. so it's not the worst case. :)
2013-07-18 14:13:08	chrisdickinson	well, just until you see the node's parent
2013-07-18 14:13:22	chrisdickinson	that's strictly out of scope for cssauron, though
2013-07-18 14:13:26	thoward	right because it's lower in the stack
2013-07-18 14:13:29	chrisdickinson	it just tells you yep or nope :)
2013-07-18 14:14:36	thoward	actually.. you could implement it such that you only have to buffer a single sibling node at a time per sub-tree
2013-07-18 14:15:37	thoward	so the mem impact wouldn't be too bad, but the implementation would get squirrely instead of clean

2013-07-18 14:22:23	thoward	personally, i'm lading this more towards semantics though, because of the diff between lucene query semantics and css selector semantics. solving very similar problems, but with different subtle implications that make them each more suited to their respective problem domains.
2013-07-18 14:22:48	thoward	how to merge the two for cross-cutting technology concerns like: query a distributed database :)
2013-07-18 14:23:28	thoward	and various shapes of data and various needs of db querying (relationships, projections, aggregates, etc)

2013-07-18 14:26:09	thoward	i see css selectors and lucene style queries as being two successful implementations of a QL that are maximally specific without too much syntax. they are both flexible and natural to understand (at least in the simple cases)
2013-07-18 14:27:27	thoward	a lot of that has to do with the use of implicit operator (eg space) and how that maps to the default semantic meaning for cojoined constraints
2013-07-18 14:27:39	jerrysv	chrisdickinson: creationix has a streaming json parser as well
2013-07-18 14:27:44	chrisdickinson	yeah
2013-07-18 14:27:50	chrisdickinson	it's part of JSONStream from dominictarr
2013-07-18 14:27:59	chrisdickinson	(and he has a new one, too)
2013-07-18 14:28:04	jerrysv	dominic may make it to portland

2013-07-18 14:28:26	chrisdickinson	problem i had was that i hadn't written a streaming json parser yet
2013-07-18 14:28:37	chrisdickinson	also that JSONStream only let you select a single kind of node
2013-07-18 14:28:44	chrisdickinson	or rather, conflated streaming and selection
2013-07-18 14:28:53	jerrysv	i've been planning on using a streaming json parser for arcgis-json to geojson conversion

2013-07-18 14:42:55	thoward	in the css selection problem domain, the primary concern is filtering a tree of things, down to a subset of things, without having to specify every possible location in the tree for those things. so, descendent selection as the default implicit operator makes sense as it solves location specificity. in lucene, the primary problem is getting relevant results from documents that have tons of ways of being specified, using maximally specific constraints
2013-07-18 14:44:20	thoward	i think
2013-07-18 14:47:04	thoward	or rather, pattern matching sub-trees, i guess is the css selector primary concern
2013-07-18 14:55:40	thoward	i once wrote a parser that would pattern match byte streams to do embedded document type detection (this was part of my work in electronic evidence processing). trying to use hueristics to detect unknown file formats.
2013-07-18 14:55:56	thoward	it had some similar features to css selectors

2013-07-19 13:51:33	Wraithan	but gf and I are looking to move in to our own place

2013-07-19 13:52:44	 *	ericholscher just moved, otherwise i'd be tempted
2013-07-19 13:52:52	JSON_voorhees	damn son
2013-07-19 13:53:07	JSON_voorhees	we could throw daggering parties :/
2013-07-19 13:53:36	ericholscher	heh :|
2013-07-19 13:53:41	 *	ericholscher was really drunk last night

2013-07-19 13:55:04	hackygolucky_	JSON_voorhees: I don't know how successful your daggering parties would be with roommates-only :P
2013-07-19 13:55:43	dlmanning	what's a daggering party?
2013-07-19 13:56:48	justinabrahms	its a very rape-y dance that some people do in jamaica, which has lead to dislocated penises.
2013-07-19 13:57:31	JSON_voorhees	the wikipedia page is pretty acurate...
2013-07-19 13:57:43	dlmanning	well that's super
2013-07-19 13:58:11	Wraithan	Some argue that it's roughly the equivalent of the Caribbeanâ€™s "cabin stabbing",
2013-07-19 13:59:35	ericholscher	its a hot topic in intellectual circles these days
2013-07-19 14:01:07	dlmanning	Not sure why anyone would undertake an activity whose associated risks include "exploded penises"
2013-07-19 14:01:46	dlmanning	You know... from a standpoint of cost/benefit analysis
2013-07-19 14:01:56	JSON_voorhees	dlmanning: party pooper

2013-07-19 14:11:24	dlmanning	Oh wow. substack has updated his streams-handbook to include discussion of streams2
2013-07-19 14:11:46	dlmanning	very cool

2013-07-19 14:17:42	hackygolucky_	and gracious of him, for how much he isn't a huge fan.
2013-07-19 14:20:54	chrisdickinson	"we could throw daggering parties" sounds like a postal service track

2013-07-19 16:49:42	JSON_voorhees	Wraithan: thats dedication
2013-07-19 17:16:49	Wraithan	Ok, I wasted some solder to see how my soldering iron worked (especially what setting it needed to be on to melt the solder at minimum
2013-07-19 17:20:28	s5fs	Wraithan: did you tin the tip as well?
2013-07-19 17:21:01	Wraithan	s5fs: uuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmm
2013-07-19 17:21:10	Wraithan	wats dat?
2013-07-19 17:21:41	s5fs	Wraithan: prep the tip by adding a touch of solder, helps for more even heat distribution
2013-07-19 17:21:51	s5fs	i'm sure videos exist :)
2013-07-19 17:22:35	Wraithan	s5fs: I was mostly just feeding solder to the tip to see if it melted
2013-07-19 17:22:35	Wraithan	I found I had to set my iron to at least 3.5/4 to get it to melt the solder
2013-07-19 17:22:58	s5fs	15watt?
2013-07-19 17:23:24	s5fs	i haven't soldered much in years. i learned to weld before i learned to solder, haha!

2013-07-22 10:33:14	hackygolucky_	I know we had been talking streams 2
2013-07-22 10:33:49	dlmanning	Urm... I could do

2013-07-22 10:35:10	dlmanning	By 'next' do you mean August or Sept?
2013-07-22 10:35:18	hackygolucky_	August
2013-07-22 10:35:20	hackygolucky_	I think
2013-07-22 10:35:37	hackygolucky_	it'll be a great follow-up from s5fs talk last month on into to irc
2013-07-22 10:35:52	hackygolucky_	and an awesome further follow-up for anyone who attends after NodeBots day.
2013-07-22 10:36:05	dlmanning	English suffers a non-standardized mapping of 'this' and 'next'
2013-07-22 10:36:35	Wraithan	August
2013-07-22 10:37:07	dlmanning	Do people want to hear about streams2?
2013-07-22 10:37:30	hackygolucky_	thinking about seeing if s5fs would be interested in me instigating the 'stump the chump' segment at PDXnode each month. Thought it was a great idea.
2013-07-22 10:39:12	chrisdickinson	would love to do more "modules you should know"
2013-07-22 10:40:07	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: Did you talk about "classic" vs. streams2 in your talk last month?
2013-07-22 10:40:12	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: that was one of my notes....for the meetups moving forward :)
2013-07-22 10:40:21	chrisdickinson	a bit about flowing vs. pull streams
2013-07-22 10:40:24	hackygolucky_	didn't know if we should have people volunteer to introduce one and talk about it
2013-07-22 10:40:47	chrisdickinson	i'd love for other people to give module talks
2013-07-22 10:40:52	hackygolucky_	or if it would be a 'The More You Know... with chrisdickinson' segment
2013-07-22 10:40:53	dlmanning	If chris has already covered it then I don't really want to be repetitive
2013-07-22 10:41:22	chrisdickinson	my original goal with 'em was to hopefully get folks who haven't talked yet to do lightning talks about modules
2013-07-22 10:41:31	hackygolucky_	dlmanning: We didn't really dig into Streams 2 as a primary focus...
2013-07-22 10:42:04	chrisdickinson	the concepts behind 'em, yes, but not streams2 themselves really
2013-07-22 10:42:08	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: cool. I'll tweet/email a call for 'somebody intro a module pleeeease'
2013-07-22 10:42:28	dlmanning	modules you should know: jquery

2013-07-22 10:44:19	dlmanning	hackygolucky_: I'd be happy to talk about implementation of the streams2 api
2013-07-22 10:44:21	hackygolucky_	\^o^/
2013-07-22 10:44:22	chrisdickinson	i would also love an "up and coming node module authors" series of talks
2013-07-22 10:44:29	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: that looks awesome.
2013-07-22 10:45:00	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: oh man, once nodebots is over, I will buy people beers about ways to make the PDXNode meetup even more awesome.
2013-07-22 10:45:05	hackygolucky_	These are great ideas.

2013-07-22 12:51:03	chrisdickinson	i'm trying to check that
2013-07-22 12:52:28	chrisdickinson	it may just be a mozilla thing.
2013-07-22 12:52:44	dlmanning	I don't see anything about it here: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:block_scoped_bindings
2013-07-22 12:54:06	chrisdickinson	yeah, i'm looking at the latest draft
2013-07-22 12:54:12	chrisdickinson	it doesn't appear to be in there
2013-07-22 12:54:43	dlmanning	crisis averted
2013-07-22 12:54:50	chrisdickinson	though
2013-07-22 12:54:59	chrisdickinson	need to figure out the semantics still
2013-07-22 12:55:08	chrisdickinson	let x; let x; === typeerror
2013-07-22 12:55:16	dlmanning	yeah
2013-07-22 12:55:32	chrisdickinson	let location at file scope in browser (may) === error
2013-07-22 12:55:47	chrisdickinson	(because it collides with `window.location`)
2013-07-22 12:56:03	chrisdickinson	x; let x; === ReferenceError
2013-07-22 12:56:09	dlmanning	Pretty silly to use let in global scope anyway
2013-07-22 12:56:22	chrisdickinson	if it's replacing var, not really
2013-07-22 12:57:02	chrisdickinson	i suppose ideally file level scope would be made sane
2013-07-22 12:57:58	chrisdickinson	the bigger issue of the two is `x; let x` being an error, since it implicitly creates a scope at the let statement that follows till the end of the block its in
2013-07-22 12:58:01	dlmanning	One could adopt a pattern of using var for file level scope
2013-07-22 12:58:09	dlmanning	and let for function scope
2013-07-22 12:58:19	dlmanning	That wouldn't be bad
2013-07-22 12:58:22	chrisdickinson	:|
2013-07-22 12:58:44	dlmanning	Differentiating file-scoped var's is a Good Thing imho
2013-07-22 12:59:36	dlmanning	but maybe I'm crazy
2013-07-22 12:59:57	chrisdickinson	it makes sense to me, but i'm just imagining having to explain that to a total newcomer to JS, or programming even
2013-07-22 13:00:49	dlmanning	newcomers do okay with arbitrary seeming conventions
2013-07-22 13:01:48	dlmanning	It's people who have established practices who get pissed
2013-07-22 13:03:23	chrisdickinson	i'm also imagining the messaging being "always use let -- don't use var!"
2013-07-22 13:03:32	chrisdickinson	which is how let has been positioned
2013-07-22 13:03:44	dlmanning	yeah...
2013-07-22 13:04:08	dlmanning	"let is (usually) the new var"
2013-07-22 13:06:13	dlmanning	personally, I'm happy to take on the extra conceptual burden if it means I get to use for(let x = 0;...) {...}
2013-07-22 13:06:43	dlmanning	Everytime I have to declare an iterator outside of a loop I die a little inside
2013-07-22 13:06:47	chrisdickinson	i just wish it could completely replace `var` in a safe way.
2013-07-22 13:07:07	chrisdickinson	i don't mind new features so long as they are a superset
2013-07-22 13:07:21	dlmanning	Well, technically it is
2013-07-22 13:07:49	dlmanning	but I get your point

2013-07-22 14:00:41	hackygolucky_	I didn't help set up the original site.
2013-07-22 14:02:30	Wraithan	hackygolucky_: I'll happily buy domains if we need them
2013-07-22 14:02:37	Wraithan	I already own like 30
2013-07-22 14:03:13	hackygolucky_	I do too. It isn't a huge deal I just want to fix it. I don't even know the guy who helped us out.
2013-07-22 14:03:17	hackygolucky_	Wonderful angel.
2013-07-22 14:09:52	chrisdickinson	ideally it's going to be a github site

2013-07-22 14:21:24	dlmanning	So I have a domain that's about to come up for reregistration: giganticsandwich.com. Worth keeping?

2013-07-22 14:22:24	Wraithan	I think I am going to rereg it just on principle

2013-07-22 14:22:50	ericholscher	i still think its a good idea

2013-07-22 14:23:10	chrisdickinson	shouldn't be hard

2013-07-22 14:23:31	s5fs	dlmanning: honestly, i'd probably drop the domain. i've had too many silly domains in the past and never did anything with it.

2013-07-22 14:23:36	s5fs	last one was 'compostableshit.com'
2013-07-22 14:23:38	chrisdickinson	haha
2013-07-22 14:24:23	dlmanning	I didn't know you could register domains with 'shit' in them
2013-07-22 14:24:47	chrisdickinson	"compostables hit", please.
2013-07-22 14:25:14	hackygolucky_	chrisdickinson: I agree. I'm really embarassed I didn't REALLY set aside time sooner.
2013-07-22 14:25:21	hackygolucky_	It's just a landing page. Which is stupid.
2013-07-22 14:25:45	chrisdickinson	i'm okay with a landing / splash page for now -- even something like the various event sites -- but just having it be static + good
2013-07-22 14:25:50	hackygolucky_	we could just make a long day of the hacktime the saturday after nodebots

2013-07-22 14:29:29	chrisdickinson	like, domain names?

2013-07-23 11:09:26	dlmanning	chrisdickinson: admit it. You like Macaw largely because it has operations called "nudging" and "pudging"

2013-07-23 15:47:05	dlmanning	You mean the html attributes?

2013-07-23 15:52:09	dlmanning	Why is this specifically like php or perl?
2013-07-23 15:52:21	Wraithan	the $variable
2013-07-23 15:52:27	dlmanning	oh yeah
2013-07-23 15:52:40	dlmanning	You do it to signify a jquery object?
2013-07-23 15:53:27	dlmanning	cause that's not a horrible idea
2013-07-23 15:53:41	Wraithan	Yeah, more specifically when we are caching jquery objects
2013-07-23 15:53:46	Wraithan	so we only do the query once
2013-07-23 15:54:02	dlmanning	I think I like that actually, as a practice
