2013-10-07 13:26:10	jodal	ericholscher, Wraithan: are there any known issues with the commit hook from github? the docs for `mopidy` seems to no longer build on push. manual builds work just fine.
2013-10-07 13:26:34	jodal	I've tried disabling and reenabling the commit hook on github, and I've deployed the payload several times
2013-10-07 13:26:39	jodal	and the queue depth on RTD is 0
2013-10-07 13:27:39	ericholscher	not afaik
2013-10-07 13:31:06	jodal	anything I should check to debug this?
2013-10-07 13:36:33	ericholscher	can you try again?
2013-10-07 13:36:39	ericholscher	i'm tailing our logs
2013-10-07 13:36:52	jodal	`test hook` button just clicked
2013-10-07 13:38:19	jodal	and there I pushed a real commit as well
2013-10-07 13:40:12	ericholscher	hrm, should work now, it was pulling the wrong version from the commit, since there were 2 develop versions in the DB -- i think there's a bug there
2013-10-07 13:41:02	ericholscher	it had one that pointed at "develop" and one at "remotes/origin/develop" :x
2013-10-07 13:41:02	jodal	hum ok
2013-10-07 13:41:20	jodal	we haven't done anything else than pushing commits to our develop branch recently
2013-10-07 13:42:01	jodal	seems to work now :-)
2013-10-07 13:42:02	jodal	thanks!
2013-10-07 13:42:02	ericholscher	yea, its on our side
2013-10-07 13:42:04	jodal	!m ericholscher
2013-10-07 13:42:05	ZenWraithBot	You're doing great work ericholscher!
