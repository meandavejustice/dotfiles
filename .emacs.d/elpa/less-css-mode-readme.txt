This mode provides syntax highlighting for LESS CSS files, plus
optional support for compilation of .less files to .css files at
the time they are saved: use `less-css-compile-at-save' to enable
this.

Command line utility "lessc" is required if setting
`less-css-compile-at-save' to t.  To install "lessc" using the
Node.js package manager, run "npm install less"

Also make sure the "lessc" executable is in emacs' PATH, example:
(setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin") exec-path))
or customize `less-css-lessc-command' to point to your "lessc" executable.

We target lessc >= 1.4.0, and thus use the `--no-color' flag by
default.  You may want to adjust `less-css-lessc-options' for
compatibility with older versions.

`less-css-mode' is derived from `css-mode', and indentation of
nested blocks may not work correctly with versions of `css-mode'
other than that bundled with recent Emacs.

You can specify per-file values for `less-css-compile-at-save',
`less-css-output-file-name' or `less-css-output-directory' using a
variables header at the top of your .less file, e.g.:

// -*- less-css-compile-at-save: t; less-css-output-directory: "../css" -*-

If you don't need CSS output but would like to be warned of any
syntax errors in your .less source, consider using `flymake-less':
