A "project" in textmate-mode is determined by the presence of
a .git directory, an .hg directory, a Rakefile, or a Makefile.

You can configure what makes a project root by appending a file
or directory name onto the `*textmate-project-roots*' list.

If no project root indicator is found in your current directory,
textmate-mode will traverse upwards until one (or none) is found.
The directory housing the project root indicator (e.g. a .git or .hg
directory) is presumed to be the project's root.

In other words, calling Go to File from
~/Projects/fieldrunners/app/views/towers/show.html.erb will use
~/Projects/fieldrunners/ as the root if ~/Projects/fieldrunners/.git
exists.
