An emacs implementation of the client side protocol of webkit and
firefox's over-the-wire debugging protocols.

jsSlime (jss for short) is designed for emacs users who program web
based javascript applications. It connects directly to the browser
and uses the tools (debugger, inspector, source code browsing,
evaluator, etc.) as they are in the browser.

jss is, currently at least, focused on the features required by
javascript developers, tools for live editing (or even just
inspecting) the DOM and CSS are not currently available.

See README.org for more details.
