This package provides an interface to ack http://beyondgrep.com -- a
tool like grep, designed for programmers with large trees of
heterogeneous source code. It builds on standard packages `compile.el'
and `ansi-color.el' and lets you seamlessly run `ack' with its large
set of options.

Ack-like tools such as the silver search (ag) and git/hg/bzr grep are
well supported too.

Usage:
Type `M-x ack' and provide a pattern to search.
Type `C-u M-x ack' to search from current project root.
Type `C-u C-u M-x ack' to interactively choose a directory to search.

While reading ack command and args from the minibuffer, the following
key bindings may be useful:

- `M-I' inserts a template for case-insensitive file name search
- `M-G' inserts a template for `git grep', `hg grep' or `bzr grep'
- `M-Y' inserts the symbol at point from the window before entering
   the minibuffer
- `TAB' completes ack options

This package does not require `--nogroup' nor `--noheading'.
Coloring is performed using the standard library ansi-color.el.
